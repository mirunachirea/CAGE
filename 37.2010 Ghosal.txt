Abstract 
We study the public policy implications of a model in which agents do not fully internalize all the conscequences of their actions. Such a model uni–es seemingly disconected models with behavioral agents. We evaluate the scope of paternalistic and libertarian-parternalistic policies in the light of our model, and propose an alternative type of approach, called soft-libertarian, which guides the decision makers in the internalization of all the conscequences of their ac- tions. Psychotherapy is one example of a soft-libertarian policy. Moreover, we show that in our behavioral framework, policies that increase the set of oppor- tunities or provide more information to the agent may not longer be individual welfare improving.

1 Introduction 
"Most powerful is he who has himself in his own power" (Seneca, 5 
BC - 65 AD) 
There is already accumulated evidence showing that the standard model of hu- 
man decision-making provides an inadequate positive description of human behavior. 
People make systematic mistakes in identi–able circumstances. People save less than 
what they would like; fail to take advantage of low interest loans available through 
life insurance policies; unsuccessfully attempt to quit smoking; maintain substantial 
balances on high-interest credit cards; etc. 
To account for this evidence, behavioral economists have proposed alternative 
models that incorporate insights from psychology. Typically, these models predict 
outcomes that are suboptimal from the decision maker™s (DM) point of view. Such 
concerns inevitably challenge the way in which welfare economics and policy analysis 
have been conducted since Samuelson™s (1938) doctrine of revealed preferences. Ac- 
cording to the revealed preferences approach, planners infer what people want from 
what they choose. When evaluating policies, planners use the ranking inferred from 
choices as a welfare standard to evaluate the e¤ect of policies on welfare. However, 
in a world in which individual™s choices do not reveal what is best for the person, 
how should welfare and policy analysis be performed? Can choices alone inform us 
whether the person is behaving sub-optimally or optimally? Under what conditions 
can choices remain as foundations for compelling welfare standards? What are the 
policy implications in a world in which people make systematic mistakes? 
In a recent paper, Dalton and Ghosal (2010a) (Henceforth DG (2010a)) proposed 
a framework to answer the –rst three questions above. Their approach highlights a 
typical mistake that leads decision-makers (DMs) to systematically end up in sub- 
optimal outcomes. In their model, DMs do not fully anticipate the consequences 
of their actions. While in some cases DMs may correctly forecast the near-term 
consequences of their actions (e.g. getting a nicotine rush from smoking a cigarette), 
they may fail to predict their more delayed consequences (e.g. developing nicotine

dependency or lung cancer from smoking). Assuming partial prediction of changes in 
psychological states or reference points is su¢ cient to unify seemingly disconnected 
models in behavioral economics. 
DG (2010a) show that all the behavioral economics models reduced in their frame- 
work are testable by a simple condition on observable choice data. This condition 
(introduced by Cherno¤, 1954 and Sen, 1971) requires that if an alternative is chosen 
in a set, it must be chosen in all subsets of it to which the alternative belongs. If 
observed behavior is consistent with this condition, we know that the DM is not fully 
internalizing all the consequences of her actions1. Moreover, they show that typically, 
when this condition is satis–ed, the outcome is sub-optimal. 
This paper builds on these results and addresses the implications of behavioral 
decisions for policy analysis. We ask how public policy should be conducted in the 
presence of behavioral DMs. In standard welfare analysis, the planner assumes that 
the DM makes the right choices according to her own normative preferences, so the 
only information needed to evaluate public policies is derived from observed choices. 
We now know that in a world with behavioral DMs, choices alone can identify whether 
the DM is internalizing all the consequences of her actions. What we cannot know by 
observing choices alone, however, is the normative preferences of the behavioral DM. 
More information is needed to provide the planner with a road map on how to perform 
policy analysis. The aim of this paper, thus, is to asses the existing policy approaches 
in a world in which the planner has incomplete information about the normative 
preferences of the DM. We show that the desirability of paternalistic interventions 
are limited by the information a planner has. We argue in favour of an alternative 
policy approach, labelled "soft-libertarian", which does not require knowledge of the 
1Note that, contrary to the recent literature of behavioural welfare economics (Bernheim and Rangel (2009) and Salant and Rubinstein (2008)), Dalton and Ghosal™s (2010a) focus is on iden- tifying the way people make decisions, instead of dealing with the inconsistencies on choice corre- spondence (e.g preferences reversal). The main point is that even when the ranking derived from choices is acyclic (which is su¢ cient for welfare analysis in Bernheim and Rangel (2009), it may still not represent what is best for the individual, and therefore, that acyclic ranking may not be an appropriate measure for welfare analysis.

normative preferences of the DM. We conclude proposing a concrete road map for 
the planner which incorporates the four policy approaches (libertarian, paternalistic, 
soft-paternalistic and soft-libertarian). 
Brie⁄y, the road map we propose is as follows. If observed choices are consistent 
with Arrow™s (1959) axiom of choice, behavior is consistent with a DM who is fully in- 
ternalizing her feedback e¤ect. In such cases, standard revealed preferences approach 
should be applied for welfare analysis and a planner should choose whatever a person 
would choose for herself. If, however, observed choices violate Arrow™s (1959) axiom 
and are consistent with Cherno¤™s (1954) axiom then the planner knows that the DM 
is typically making a suboptimal decision: there is scope for intervention. 
How should the planner intervene in those cases? We –rst consider the two most 
prominent existing policy approaches: hard-paternalism and libertarian-paternalism 
(Thaler and Sustein, 2003) and evaluate them in light of our framework. A pa- 
ternalistic planner will either choose the optimal action for the DM or induce the 
DM to choose that optimal action via taxes. A libertarian-paternalistic planner will 
choose the reference point (or the distribution of reference points) such that the DM 
is induced to choose the optimal action. 
In order to be implemented, both approaches require the planner to have informa- 
tion about the DM™s normative preferences and the intensity of her mistake. The cost 
of acquiring this information varies across di¤erent situations. There are situations, 
for example, in which the DM will choose suboptimally with high probability (e.g. 
children, adolescents or adults incapable of engaging in contracts). In these extreme 
cases the cost is almost zero and paternalistic interventions make perfect sense. Also, 
there are situations where DMs (even highly educated adults) choose systematically 
suboptimal outcomes and where their normative preferences are clear for the plan- 
ner. An example of this situation that has received considerable research attention 
is default options for 401(k) retirement plans. If it is objectively bene–cial to invest 
in a 401k plan (i.e. normative preferences are clear), but people tend to stick with 
the status quo (i.e. the mistake is also clear), then it may make sense to change the 
usual default from not contributing (with the possibility of signing up) to contribut- 
4 

========5========

ing (with the possibility of opting out). In this cases, the libertarian paternalistic 
approach proposed by Thaler and Sustein is the most cost-e¤ective intervention. 
However, in most of the cases, the probability that the planner knows the individ- 
ual normative preferences is very low, so the applicability of hard or soft paternalistic 
policies is, at least, contentious. For instance take the case of smoking. Clearly, there 
are smokers who don™t want to quit smoking and whose behavior is perfectly aligned 
with their normative preferences. There are also smokers who wish to quit smoking, 
who attempt to do so, but who fail. In such cases, paternalistic policies will inevitably 
violate the autonomy of some DMs (those who do not wish to quit smoking). 
We propose an alternative policy approach labelled ﬁsoft-libertarianﬂwhich does 
not require the planner to know or impose the normative preferences of the individual. 
We argue in favour of interventions that directly target the abilities needed to inter- 
nalize the feedback from actions to psychological states. In most cases, such abilities 
are not simply learned with a lea⁄et informing about the consequences of actions. 
The mechanism behind may be very subtle, and it may require the arrangement of 
institutional structures such as behavioral therapies that enhance emotional intelli- 
gence for anger control, to reduce anxiety or to control temptations. The role of the 
planner should be to create the institutional structure to assist the DM™s in achieving 
her own normative preferences. For that, the DM should be aware of the (sometimes 
unconscious) mechanisms guiding her behavior and determining her wellbeing. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 brie⁄y presents a 
special case of the model of DG (2010a), paper to which we refer the reader for addi- 
tional details. Section 3 evaluates the scope of existing public policies and proposes the 
soft-libertarian approach. Section 4 provides philosophical and psychological grounds 
for the normative approach proposed. Section 5 concludes.

2 The model 
Let p be a psychological state (with P the corresponding set) and a the action chosen 
by the DM (with A the corresponding set2). The preferences of the DM are repre- 
sented by a utility function u : A  P ! <. In addition, there is a feedback e¤ect 
from a to p represented by the function ˇ : A ! P. A consistent decision state is a 
pair (a; p) such that p = ˇ(a). 
In a standard decision problem (SDP), the DM fully internalizes the feedback 
e¤ect via the map ˇ : A ! P and solves: 
Maxfa2Agv (a) 
where v (a) = u(a; ˇ (a)). 
The FOC characterizing an interior solution a to a SDP is 
@av(a) = @au(a; ˇ(a)) + @ 
pu(a 
; ˇ(a))@aˇ(a) = 0 
In a Behavioral decision problem (BDP) the DM doesn™t internalize the feedback 
from actions to the psychological state. At a solution to a BDP, we require that (a) 
given the utility parameter, the action is optimal for the decision maker and (b) the 
utility parameter is generated, via the feedback e¤ect, by the chosen action. Formally, 
for given p, let  (p) = arg maxa2A u(a; p). A solution to a BDP is a pair (^a;p^) such 
that (i) Given p^, a^ 2  (^p) and (ii) p^= ˇ (^a). 
The FOC characterizing an interior solution (^a;p^) to a BDP is 
@au(^a; ˇ(^a)) = 0 and p^= ˇ(^a) = 0 
In a BDP, DMs choose a pair (a; p = ˇ(a)) such that u(a; p = ˇ(a))  u(a0; p = 
ˇ(a)): Note that a0 is now paired with p = ˇ(a) and not with p0 = ˇ(a0). This 
‚mispairing™is the decision-making mistake. Behavioral DMs compare actions using 
the psychological state associated with their chosen action, p = ˇ(a) instead of varying 
the psychological state as they consider alternative actions. 
2In what follows we will assume that both 
P and A are compact convex subset of a –nite dimen- sional Euclidian space. 
6 

========7========

Following Harsanyi (1954), in order to make welfare assessments in this setting, 
we will assume intrapersonal comparability of preferences. Formally, in our setting, 
the pair (a; p) dominates the decision state (a0; p0) when u(a; p) > u(a0; p0). A consis- 
tent decision state (a; p) is e¢ cient if there is no other consistent decision state that 
dominates it. 
Clearly, except in exceptional cases, the outcomes of a BDP will be welfare dom- 
inated by the SDP outcome. In that sense, in a BDP the decision maker imposes an 
(internal) constraint on his decision problem as he does not internalize the feedback 
e¤ect from one component of his object of choice into the other. Because of this ad- 
ditional constraint, behavioral equilibria are likely to be sub-optimal, which explains 
self-defeating behavior. 
How strong is the assumption of an internal constraint? Psychological states can 
have di¤erent interpretations. They must a¤ect DM™s preference ranking over actions 
and, in turn, they must be a¤ected by the DM™s actions (at least partially). Examples 
of endogenous psychological states are aspirations, beliefs, moods, states of mind, 
temptations, motivations, self-con–dence, reference points, the same environment, 
life styles, etc. 
Our framework is closely related to the literature on a¤ective forecasting and pro- 
jection bias (Loewenstein et al, 2003), where people make systematic inaccurate pre- 
dictions about how they will feel in situations, even if the situation people experience 
objectively matches the situation they imagined. It is shown that people misjudge 
self capacities to carry out certain actions (Baumeister and Scher, 1988), mispredict 
a¤ective reactions overestimating regret and rejoicing (Sevdalis and Harvey, 2007) 
and fail to bear in mind that they will adapt (Fagerlin et al, 2005).3 
In sum, we model people who fail to fully internalize how their own psychological 
states will change with their own actions. This assumption alone is su¢ cient to unify 
3Our model is consistent with the approach from social psychology called "reciprocal determin- ism" (Bandura 2001). This approach sustain that the way people interpret the results of their own behaviour informs and alters their environments and personal factors which, in turn, inform and alter subsequent behaviour through an "environmental feedback e¤ect."

seemingly disconnected models in behavioral economics. These models include sit- 
uations where the preference parameter corresponds to the decision maker™s current 
state (Tversky and Kahneman, 1991), beliefs (Geanakoplos et al, 1989; Akerlof and 
Dickens, 1982), emotional states (Loewenstein, et al, 2003; Bracha and Brown, 2007), 
reference points (Shalev, 2000, Koszegi, 2005; Koszegi and Rabin, 2006, 2007), aspi- 
rations (Ray, 2006; Dalton et al, 2010) or past consumption (Von Weizsacker, 1971; 
Hammond, 1976; Pollak, 1978). 
From DG (2010a) we know that each of these behavioral economics models are 
testable by a single condition on observable choice data. This condition (introduced by 
Cherno¤, 1954 and Sen, 1971) requires that if an alternative is chosen in a set, it must 
be chosen in all subsets of it to which the alternative belongs. If observed behavior 
is consistent with this condition, we know that the DM is not fully internalizing all 
the consequences of her actions. Moreover, from DG (2010a) we also know that when 
this condition is satis–ed, the outcome is typically sub-optimal. 
In the following section we build on these results and study the implications of 
behavioral decisions for policy analysis. 
3 Behavioral Public Policy 
What are the policy implications of behavioral decision making, i.e. assuming that 
people don™t necessarily follow their own best interests? 
The goal of any public policy ought to be to maximize people™s well-being. The 
route a social planner chooses to take in order to achieve that goal will depend on 
the social planner™s beliefs, her information on underlying normative preferences and 
on the way the individual chooses i.e. whether the DM is solving a BDP or a SDP. 
From DG (2010a) we know that we can infer only from choices whether the DM 
is solving a BDP or a SDP. If observed choices are consistent with Arrow™s axiom 
of choice, behavior is consistent with a DM who is solving a SDP. In such cases, 
standard revealed preferences approach should be applied for welfare analysis and 
a planner should choose whatever a person would choose for herself. If, however, 
8 

========9========

observed choices violate Arrow™s (1959) axiom and are consistent with Cherno¤™s 
(1954) axiom then the planner knows that the DM is solving a BDP and, typically, 
making a suboptimal decision. In such cases, there is scope for intervention. Which 
type of intervention is more desirable will depend on the information a social planner 
has about a DM™s preferences. Below we introduce some additional notation to clarify 
this argument. 
Fix (A; P; ˇ). As before, let v(a) = u(a; ˇ(a)). We assume that the social plan- 
ner™s goal is to maximize v(a) choosing an action a 2 A. We consider a world in 
which information is incomplete in two ways. First, the social planner may have in- 
complete information about the intensity of the mistake of the DM. We assume that 
the planner attaches a probability  (respectively 1 
 ) to the DM solving a SDP (re- 
spectively BDP). Second, the social planner may have incomplete information about 
the normative preferences of the DM (i.e. preferences and feedback e¤ect). We as- 
sume he attaches a probability 0 to correct preferences and feedback e¤ect but with 
probability (1 
 0) he uses a completely wrong set of preferences or feedback e¤ect 
resulting in attaching a weight (1 
 0) to some function v0 : A ! R, v0() = 6 v() 
where v0(a) = u0(a; ˇ0(a)). 
In this scenario, we distinguish between four di¤erent kinds of interventions: 
(A) direct paternalism: to impose a choice a on the DM; 
(B) indirect paternalism: to impose a tax or a subsidy on the DM; 
(C) liberarian-paternalism: to choose the initial p0 (e.g. reference point) for the DM; 
(D) soft-libertarian: to use psychological therapies that allow the DM to internal- 
ize the feedback e¤ect. 
In what follows, we review these four approaches in a world with behavioral DMs. 
We –nish the section showing that policies such as increasing opportunities or provid- 
ing information that in a standard economic framework are known to be individual 
welfare improving, may not longer be in a world with behavioral DMs. 
9 

========10========

3.1 Direct paternalism 
Dworkin (2002) de–nes paternalism as "the interference of a state or an individual 
with another person, against their will, and justi–ed by a claim that the person inter- 
fered with will be better o¤ or protected from harm." 
This de–nition assumes that (a) the planner has complete information about the 
DM™s normative preferences (i.e. 0 = 1) and (b) the planner knows that the DM 
is solving a BDP, so typically, she wouldn™t choose optimally in the absence of the 
intervention (i.e. 0 <  < 1). In which case, the planner believes that the individual 
solves: 
Maxfa2Agv(a) + (1 
 )u(a; p) 
where with some probability  she takes the feedback e¤ect from actions to preference 
parameters into account, and with some probability (1 
is: 
" 
 
@au(~a; ˇ(~a)) +@pu(~a; ˇ(~a))@aˇ(~a) 
p~= ˇ(~a) (4) 
 ) she does not. The FOC 
# 
+ (1 
 ) [@au(~a;p~)] = 0 
where (~a();p~()) denote the solution of the problem. Note that (~a(1);p~(1)) = 
(a; p), the outcome of the SDP while (~a(0);p~(0)) = (^a;p^), an outcome of the BDP. 
Suppose now a more realistic scenario, in which we allow the planner to have in- 
complete information about the DM. The planner attaches a probability 0 to correct 
preferences and feedback e¤ect but with probability (1 
 0) he uses a completely 
wrong set of preferences or feedback e¤ect resulting in attaching a weight (1 
 0) to 
some function v0 : A ! R, v0() = v() where v0(a) = u0(a; ˇ0(a)). Then, the the social 
6 
planner maximizes: 
Maxfa2Ag0v(a) + (1 
The FOC is:" 
0 
@au(a0; ˇ(a0)) 
+@pu(a0; ˇ(a0))@aˇ(a0) 
# 
+ (1 
 0) 
 0)v0(a) 
" 
# 
@au0(a0; ˇ0(a0)) +@pu0(a0; ˇ0(a0))@aˇ0(a0) 
= 0 (5) 
10 

========11========

Let [a0(); p0 ()] denote the solution. Note that [a0(1); a0 (1)] = [a; p]:4 
It follows that the extent of direct paternalism is limited by the trade-o¤ between 
 and 0. If the DM is solving a SDP with very high probability (high ) and the so- 
cial planner has relatively imprecise information about the individual (low 0), then 
intervention may cause more harm than good. On the other hand, if it is highly 
likely that the DM is solving a BDP ( is low) and the social planner has precise 
information about the individual (high 0) then intervention could lead to welfare 
improvements. This trade-o¤ explains, for example, why the sale of cigarettes and 
alcohol is legal for adult decision-makers (who are supposed to be of high ) but 
prohibited to minors. Children do not know what is on their best interest and their 
actions often fail to re⁄ect valid preferences, probably because they give insu¢ cient 
weight to consequences. Therefore, few economists will reject the view that a libertar- 
ian approach is appropriate when the DM is a "responsible" adult and a paternalistic 
approach is suitable when the DM is a child. However, the spectrum of DMs in real 
world is not only determined by these two types of DMs. We know from empirical 
work in psychology and behavioral economics that (highly educated) adults make 
suboptimal choices. As highlighted by Bernheim and Rangel (2007) "it™s di¢ cult to 
justify, objectively, the sense in which the revealed preferences of an irresponsible 
nineteen-year-old are legitimate, whereas those of a fourteen-year-old are not. While 
turning eighteen has profound legal signi–cance, it doesn™t discontinuously change the 
mechanics of decision-making." Usually, the planner has vague information about  
and 0; which weakens the case for libertarian and paternalistic policies. We will ar- 
gue later on for an alternative approach, soft-libertarian, as solution to this problem. 
But before we embark on this route, we will discuss the cases for indirect paternalism 
and libertarian-paternalism. 
4In the extreme case in which the planner had complete information about normative preferences and also believed that the DM solves a SDP ( = 1 and 0 = 1) we would be back to the standard welfare economics approach, in which the planner would simply choose a 2 arg maxa2A v(a), i.e. what the person would choose for herself. So our framework incorporates standard welfare analysis as a special case. 
11 

========12========

3.2 Indirect paternalism 
In the transferable utility case, instead of imposing an action directly on the indi- 
vidual, the social planner could impose a per unit tax (or a subsidy) which would 
induce the individual to make the right choice. If –rst-order conditions are valid in 
characterizing an optimum for both a SDP or a BDP, then the tax t 2 < would work 
as follows. The outcome (^a;p^) of a BDP with a tax t 2 < satis–es the –rst-order 
condition: 
@au(^a;p^) + t = 0; 
p^= ˇ(^a): 
(6) 
By setting t =  @pu(a; ˇ(a))@aˇ(a), that is, at a level in which the marginal bene–t of choosing a suboptimal action equals the marginal internal damage that 
DM imposes on herself, the planner would ensure that at a BDP, the DM chooses the 
same action as in a SDP. Clearly, such a tax is equivalent to a Pigouvian tax per-unit, 
but instead of internalizing externalities producing on others, the tax ensures that 
the DM internalizes the externalities produced on herself. 
Note, however, that the above solution relies on the social planner not only having 
information about the underlying preferences and feedback e¤ect but also on whether 
the individual is solving a BDP or a SDP. 
Suppose that the social planner has incomplete information about the DM™s way 
of solving the problem and attaches a probability  to the DM solving a SDP. It 
follows from (5) that by imposing a tax t() =  (1  ) [  @pu(a; ˇ(a))@aˇ(a)], the social planner ensures that [~a();p~()] = [a; p]. Note that the absolute value 
of t is decreasing in  and will be a function of the degree of uncertainty the social 
planner has about whether the DM is solving a SDP or a BDP. However, for any –xed 
value of t(), the decision-maker never achieves a SDP outcome. If the DM is solving 
a SDP, there will be distortion; further, by substitution in (6), the actual outcome of 
a BDP will not coincide with that of a SDP. 
Suppose now the social planner attaches a probability 0 to the correct pref- 
erences and feedback e¤ect and with probability (1 
 
0) the social planner uses 
a completely wrong set of preferences or feedback e¤ect resulting in attaching a 
12 

========13========

weight (1 
 
0) to some function v~ : A ! R, v~() 6 = v(): Then, the target for 
the social planner is [a0(0); p0 (0)]. If the social planner believes that the individ- 
ual is solving a BDP with probability 1, the social planner will set a tax t0() = 
 (1 
 ) [  @pu(a0(0); ˇ(a0(0))@aˇ(a0(0))] which will distort matters further a con- 
clusion reinforced if, in addition, the social planner believes with probability 1 
  
the individual is solving a BDP. 
As in the case of direct paternalism, the extent, and usefulness, of indirect pater- 
nalism is limited by the information available to the social planner. 
3.3 Libertarian-paternalism 
So far we have considered only the case of "hard" paternalism, in which the social 
planner chooses an action instead of the individual or sets a tax to induce the in- 
dividual to choose a particular action. Intermediate forms of soft-paternalism have 
recently emerged as a compromise between fully libertarian and hard-paternalistic 
views5. The ultimate goal of soft-paternalistic policies is to guide individual™s behav- 
ior in directions that will promote individual™s welfare while minimizing coercion. 
Thaler and Sustein (2003) recommend a type of soft-paternalism labelled liber- 
tarian paternalism. They argue that, in the cases in which the choice is reference- 
dependent (e.g. status quo bias or default option bias), the social planner should 
choose the reference point or default option in order to steer people™s choices in desir- 
able directions. In this way, the social planner would achieve her goal of maximizing 
people™s welfare without forcing anybody to do anything they wouldn™t do. 
To what extent are their conclusions a¤ected when reference points are endoge- 
nous? Note that if there is a unique outcome of a BDP, then the initial policy- 
determined reference point will not have an impact on the steady state preferences 
to which the DM with adaptive preferences converges to. On the other hand, if the 
BDP has multiple behavioral outcomes, then the initial policy-determined reference 
5See Loewenstein and Haisley (2008) for a review of methodological issues that arise in designing, implementing and evaluating the e¢ cacy of "soft" paternalism. See also Koorman and Prast (2010) for discussion of libertarian paternalistic policies related to health and saving behaviour.

========14========

point might have an impact by selecting which steady-state preferences the decision- 
maker converges to. Consider the following example. Suppose p is the label attached 
to objects of choice (such as "default option"). Let A = fa; a0g and P = fp = "a is 
the default option", p0 = "a0is the default option"g. Consistency requires that if the 
chosen action is a the default option is p while if the chosen action is a0 the default 
option is p0. In a BDP, the individual will take the label as given (without taking 
into account that it is a characteristic pertaining to the object) and may choose a 
over a0 at p and a0 over a at p0. In a SDP, the individual will consider the label as a 
characteristic of the available object of choice and will choose the optimal pair which 
without loss of generality we may set as (a; p). Solving a SDP in this setting requires 
DM to be aware that frames (such as labels or defaults) can mislead her decision, so 
she should internalize that when making her optimal choice. We acknowledge that 
this is a strong assumption to make. In fact, in some cases (like the default options 
for 401(k) retirement plans), the planner knows the normative preferences of the DMs 
(it is objectively bene–cial to invest in a 401k plan), and knows that most of the DMs 
make the same mistake (they tend to stick with the status quo). So in those cases, it 
makes sense to change the usual default from not contributing (with the possibility 
of signing up) to contributing (with the possibility of opting out). 
However, there are many other cases in which the planner has incomplete informa- 
tion about the normative preferences, the feedback e¤ect and the mistake the person 
makes. In such situations, we argue that the libertarian-paternalistic approach can 
be misleading. 
To justify our claim, consider the following example where an internal state of 
the individual (such as self-con–dence) adjusts to her actions. The payo¤-relevant 
variables are: 
(i) a set of actions A = fa;ag, a < a, where a represents maintaining the existing 
status quo and a represents changing the existing status quo by undertaking higher 
e¤ort (e.g. going to College) and 
(ii) a set of psychological states P where p 2 P represents the internal state of 
the DM (e.g. self-con–dence level). 
14 

========15========

The preferences of the DM are represented by a utility function u(a; p) = b(a) 
 
c(a; p); where b(a) is the bene–t the individual obtains from her new social status and 
c(a; p) is the perceived cost of e¤ort, which is decreasing in p but increasing in a. For 
simplicity, assume that u(a; p), the DM™s utility from preserving the status quo, is 
normalized to zero for all values of p and for each p; u(a; p) is the perceived net gain 
(or loss) to the DM in deviating from the status quo. Then, under the assumptions 
made so far, u(a; p0) > u(a; p), for p0 > p. For example, if a is interpreted as going to 
College, and a as staying at home, this inequality implies that the higher the person™s 
self-con–dence, the more she enjoys College. In addition, assume that u(a; p) is 
continuous in p. 
For each p; the DM solves the maximization problem maxa2A u(a; p). This gener- 
ates an optimal action correspondence  (p) = arg maxa2A u(a; p). Under our assump- 
tions, there is a unique solution p^ to the equation u(a; p) = 0. The threshold p^ is the 
level of self-con–dence that makes the DM indi¤erent between going to College and 
staying in the status-quo. Given p, the optimal action correspondence is determined 
as follows: 
(i) whenever p < p^, a =  (p); 
(ii) whenever p > p^, a =  (p); 
(iii) whenever p = ^p, fa;ag =  (p). 
Therefore, a DM with su¢ ciently low p will prefer to remain in status-quo, whereas 
an individual with su¢ ciently high p will see it as convenient to exert e¤ort to change 
her status-quo. 
The feedback e¤ect from actions to p is captured by an increasing function ˇ : 
fa;ag ! P; that assigns a p to each action. For example, the fact that the DM goes 
to College generates a higher p. Let p = ˇ (a) and p = ˇ (a), p < p, be the lowest 
and highest values of the psychological variable consistent with the actions available. 
That is, going to College is consistent with endorsing high self-con–dence, and staying 
at home is consistent with endorsing low self-con–dence. 
In a SDP, the DM internalizes the e¤ect of her actions on her self-con–dence and 
then chooses a 2 argmaxa2Au(a; ˇ(a)). In other words, the standard DM is able to 
15 

========16========

predict how it will feel to be a student. She anticipates that by going to College she 
will gain con–dence, and given that con–dence, she will make her decision. 
In a BDP, the DM takes as given the e¤ect of her actions on her con–dence and 
then chooses a 2 argmaxa2Au(a; p) given p 2 P. The initial level of con–dence is crucial to predict the outcome of a behavioral DM as the DM will not foresee that 
going to College will give her a higher con–dence, maybe needed to make the decision 
to go to College in the –rst place. 
Suppose p  p^  p: Then, there is a unique SDP outcome (a;p), but two BDP 
outcomes f(a; p);(a;p)g6. Call (a; p) a type I equilibrium and (a;p) a type II equi- 
librium. In a type I equilibrium, there is no change in the status quo while in a type 
II equilibrium there is a change in the status quo: observe that a type II equilibrium 
welfare dominates a type I equilibrium. 
If the social planner knows the preferences and the feedback e¤ect, by –xing p0 > p^, irrespective of whether the individual is solving a SDP or a BDP, the individual will 
end up choosing a: the social planner can always ensure that the individual will always 
end up at a type II equilibrium. 
However, for this to be e¤ective, the planner must know the correct value of p^ 
which, in turn, requires the planner to know the underlying preferences. If the social 
planner does not know this, she could end up choosing a value of p0 that is too low and therefore, ine¤ective. 
Again, as in the cases of direct and indirect paternalism, the extent, and useful- 
ness, of soft paternalism is limited by the information available to the social planner. 
In light of this problem, we propose an alternative policy approach labelled ﬁsoft- 
libertarianﬂ which does not require the planner to know or impose the normative 
preferences of the individual. We argue in favour of interventions that directly target 
the abilities needed to internalize the feedback from actions to psychological states. 
6The two other cases are: 
(i) if p < p;^ there exists a unique standard and behavioural equilibrium: (a; p) = (a; p); (ii) if p > p;^ there exists a unique standard and behavioural equilibrium: (a; p) = (a;p): 
16 

========17========

3.4 Soft-libertarian 
Finally, we consider a soft-libertarian approach which directly addresses the point that 
in a BDP, the individual doesn™t internalize the feedback e¤ect. A soft-libertarian 
policy stands in between a fully libertarian and a libertarian-paternalistic approach. 
Instead of being the social planner the ﬁarchitect of the decision-maker choiceﬂ as 
proposed by the libertarian-paternalistic approach, we propose the DM herself to 
become the ﬁarchitect of her own choiceﬂ or, in Elster™s (1983) words, her ﬁown 
character plannerﬂ. In that sense, the approach is not coercive. Moreover, it does 
not require the social planner to have information about underlying preferences, the 
feedback e¤ect or the decision making procedure. If observed choices satisfy Cherno¤ 
axiom (which characterizes a BDP and violates SDP) then helping the DM to learn 
how to internalize his own feedback e¤ect will improve her welfare (at least weekly). 
Note however, that in order to internalize the feedback e¤ect, the DM must ac- 
knowledge the existence of a feedback map, understand which actions and how they 
impact on her psychological states, and –nally internalize it. We acknowledge that 
this may not be an easy task for the DM. It requires capacities and information that 
may seem unimportant with the lens of standard economic theory but they are crucial 
in the framework proposed here. 
An important policy question is how a DM gets to learn to internalize her feedback 
e¤ects. The answer to this question depends very much on the type of decision 
problem at hand. Simple feedback e¤ects can be learned with personal experience or 
the experiences of similar others (e.g. role models)7. For example, as highlighted in 
Beshears et al. (2008), only after paying late fees video renters learn to return their 
videos on time (Fishman and Pope, 2007) and credit card account holders learn to pay 
their bills on time (Agarwal et al., 2007). In a similar vein, sex workers begin using 
condoms only when the information about the use of condoms is provided by other 
trained sex workers and no behavioral change is observed when the information is 
7Dalton et al (2010) propose a behavioural decision model with aspirations failure where it is shown the way role models can impact aspirations and help the DM to scape from a lack of aspirations/poverty trap. 
17 

========18========

provided by bureaucrats (Rao and Walton, 2004). There is also empirical evidence of 
sophisticated people who actually implement strategies that show an internalization 
of a feedback e¤ect. For example, some people with self-control problems choose 
activities that reduce the likelihood of encountering cues that trigger binges. They 
purchase costly pre-commitment devices like small packages of junk food even when 
the unit price is lower for larger packages (Wertenbroch, 1998) or self-impose costly 
deadlines to overcome procrastination (Ariely and Wertenbroch, 2002). 
More complex feedback e¤ects (such as those involving emotions), however, may 
require some sort of expert advice in order to be learned and internalized. One class 
of expert advice consistent with our framework is psychological therapies (such us 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)8. Most if not all psychological therapies are about 
identifying the appropriate coping strategies (i.e. the feedback e¤ects) to modify 
thoughts, beliefs, behavior and environments to improve people™s psychological states 
(Hawton et al, 1989). Clinical psychologists know why people make mistakes in the 
–rst place (they know possible feedback e¤ects), and, more importantly, they apply 
this understanding in their daily practice. A key normative principle of psycholog- 
ical therapies is not to force the DM to undertake any action that the DM doesn™t 
want. The main aim is to help the DM to achieve what the own DM considers the 
good life. In that sense, individual autonomy is not only fully respected but also en- 
hanced. Psychological therapies have been shown to be e¤ective in helping people to 
cope with depression, stress, anger, fear, anxiety or low self-con–dence. They either 
change the DMs response to a situation (emotion-focused problem) or change the 
environment (problem-focused coping) (Lazarus, 1984; Hawton et. al, 1989). In the 
case of addiction, behavioral therapies teach cue-avoidance without providing new 
information (Bernheim and Rangel, 2007). As argued by Baron (2006), emotions are 
(partly) under people™s control and individuals can "induce or suppress emotions in 
themselves almost on cue." Some people may even reshape their character, so that 
their emotional responses change. 
8Lowenstein and Haslie (2008) mention therapy as a methaphore for the new type of behavioural economics policies. We don™t consider it as a metaphore, but as a policy tool itself. 
18 

========19========

What types of institutions can provide the capacities needed to internalize the 
feedback e¤ect? As Mullainathan (2006) argues, good institutions also help to reduce 
problems that arise within a person. An example of such institution is ﬁThe Improv- 
ing Access to Psychological Therapiesﬂ programme (IAPT) initiated in 2006 in the 
UK. IAPT aims at o¤ering evidence based psychological therapies and psychological 
support to a wide range of the population. Layard et al. (2008) argue that IAPT 
does not only improve individual wellbeing but also social wellbeing by reducing other 
public costs associated with psychological disorders (e.g. welfare bene–ts and med- 
ical costs) and increasing revenues (e.g. taxes from return to work and increased 
productivity). 
3.5 Other standard policies 
To conclude this section, we highlight other typical policies that are thought to be 
(at least weakly) welfare improving, but they can also be misleading in a behavioral 
framework. For instance, it easy to construct examples where providing more infor- 
mation or more opportunities to the DM may make her worse-o¤. Below we present 
two of these examples. 
More information may make the decision-maker worse-o¤ 
Consider a decision problem with payo¤ relevant uncertainty, with two states of 
the world f1; 2g where preferences are 
1 ! 
a1 
a2 
p1  1 
p2 0 
p3 0 
a3 
0 1 
3 4 
1 2 1 
2 ! 
a1 
a2 
p1 1 
p2 4 
p3 1 
a3 
1 2 0 
3 0 
0  1 
where ˇ(ai) = pi. Suppose, to begin with, the DM has to choose before uncertainty is resolved. At the time when she makes the decision, the individual attaches a 
19 

========20========

probability 
1 
2 
to 1 and 
1 
2 
to 2. In this case, expected payo¤ matrix is 
a1 
p1 0 
p2 2 
a2 
a3 
1 4 1 2 
3 2 
p3 1 2 1 4 0 
It follows that the unique BDP outcome is (a2; p2) with expected payo¤ 3. 
Next, suppose that the DM knows with probability one the true state of the world. 
Then, when the state of the world is 1, a3 strictly dominates all other actions and 
the unique BDP outcome is (a3; p3) with payo¤ 1 and when the state of the world 
is 2, a1 strictly dominates all other actions and the unique BDP outcome is (a1; p1) with payo¤ 1. Therefore, the decision-maker is worse-o¤ with more information910. 
More actions may make the decision-maker worse-o¤ 
Consider –rst a situation where the payo¤ table is 
a1 
a1  1 
a2 0 
a2 
0 
3 
where ˇ(ai) = pi. The outcome of the BDP is (a2; p2) with payo¤ 3. Now, expand the set of choices so that the following payo¤ table represents the decision problem 
a1 
a1  1 
a2 0 
a3 0 
a2 
a3 
0 1 
3 4 
1 2 
where ˇ(ai) = pi. Note that the unique BDP outcome is (a3; p3) with payo¤ 2 < 3. This means that although the action set of the decision-maker has been expanded so 
that (a) the ranking of existing actions is una¤ected and (b) the new action strictly 
dominates all existing actions, the individual is made worse-o¤. 
9Note that in this example we are referring only to information that solves the uncertainty about exogenous states of the world. Our statement "the decision-maker is worse-o¤ with more information" would not be right in the case in which additional information helps the decision- maker to learn about the feedback. 
10The example is consistent with Carrillo and Mariotti™s (2000) results, although we don™t need a dynamic model with time-inconsistent preferences to make the point. 
20

4 Normative grounds 
The policy approach advocated in this paper is based on autonomy as a normative 
criterion for welfare evaluation. As argued by philosopher Friednman (2003, p. 4) 
ﬁautonomous behavior is based on the deeper wants and commitments of the person, 
is partly caused by her re⁄ections on and rea¢ rmations of them.ﬂTo realize auton- 
omy a person must –rst somehow re⁄ects on her wants and takes up an evaluative 
stance with respect to them. Friednman (2003, p. 4) makes very clear the endo- 
geneity of psychological states when she argues that ﬁfor choices and actions to be 
autonomous, the choosing and acting self as the particular self she is must play a role 
in determining them [...] When wants and desires lead to choice or action without 
having been self-re⁄ectively endorsed by the person, the resulting choices and actions 
are not autonomous.ﬂThe notion of self-government (the capacity to govern oneself) 
is central to the concept of autonomy (Trout, 2005). A standard DM, as de–ned in 
our framework, captures precisely that notion. As Ryan and Deci (2006) illustrate, a 
man who decides to "have another drink" would not be autonomous unless, in re⁄ect- 
ing on this motive, he could fully endorse it. The preferences that the standard DM 
maximizes are exactly the preferences that Elster (1983, p.22) de–nes as autonomous 
preferences: ﬁthose that have been deliberately chosen, acquired or modi–ed Œeither 
by an act of will or by a process of character planning.ﬂ 
The soft-libertarian approach, therefore, advocates interventions that promotes 
the autonomy of the DM. The way in which the autonomy is enhanced is by helping 
the DM to internalize her feedback e¤ects and thus to become a standard DM. 
5 Final Remarks 
We have addressed the implications of behavioral decisions for policy analysis. We 
have proposed a concrete road map for the planner which incorporates the four policy 
approaches (libertarian, paternalistic, soft-paternalistic and soft-libertarian). 
The desirability of paternalistic interventions are limited by the information a 
21 

========22========

planner has about an individual™s normative preferences. We argued in favour of an al- 
ternative policy approach labelled "soft-libertarian" which does not require knowledge 
of the normative preferences of the DM. Consistent with autonomy being the norma- 
tive criterion to adopt, soft-libertarian interventions aim at enhancing or sustaining 
individual autonomy. Examples of such interventions are cognitive and behavioral 
therapies that teach how to manage stress, anxiety, temptation and self-con–dence or 
correct maladaptive beliefs that can lead to systematic self-defeating behavior. In- 
terventions with this type of aims are not only restricted to psychotherapies, though. 
Social programs aiming at increasing participants™self-con–dence or aspirations can 
also be autonomy supportive. In general, these interventions have the explicit ob- 
jective of empowering people, i.e. to help them to increase the sense of control over 
their lives. Policies such as fostering empowerment or emotional intelligence have 
been largely advocated in other social disciplines but somehow disregarded in the 
literature of Economics. In this paper we have derived those policy implications from 
a framework that reduces many existing seemingly disconnected models in behavioral 
economics.
