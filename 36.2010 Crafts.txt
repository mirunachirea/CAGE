Abstract: We explore the links between openness and economic performance in Britain between 1870 and 1999. The key findings are: (1) As a result of the openness of the British  economy, agriculture was unusually small in nineteenth century Britain, allowing resources to  be deployed in the higher value added industrial and service sectors. This benefit of openness  is rarely considered alongside the costs to British industry of retaining open markets when  tariffs were being raised against British exports. (2) Many writers criticise the cosmopolitan  service sector for neglecting domestic industry. However, this ignores the importance of the  outward orientation of services for service sector productivity, and the growing importance of  services for productivity performance overall. (3) The trend of British industrial performance  was not improved by protection when it was applied in the 1930s, despite the claims of the  tariff reformers. Furthermore, protective attempts to avoid de-industrialisation after World  War II had an adverse effect on productivity performance in industry and in the aggregate  economy.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The historical literature contains a range of views on the links between openness and  
productivity performance in Britain since the late nineteenth century. For one group of  
writers, British prosperity has been founded on participation in the international economy,  
with a policy of free trade seen as beneficial irrespective of any protectionist policies pursued  
by other countries (Imlah, 1958; Capie, 1983; 1994; Edelstein, 1982; Irwin, 1996). For others,  
however, the roots of British relative economic decline can be traced back to the continued  
adherence to liberal principles when other countries were abandoning them. Within this  
group, there are those such as Aaronovitch and Smith (1981) and Bairoch (1993), who see  
protectionism as a way of restructuring the economy onto a more favourable development  
path, and others who see the abandonment of free trade in Britain as a second-best policy at  
particular times, necessary as a response to the rise of protectionism abroad (Marrison, 1996;  
Kitson and Solomou, 1990). Although there are now large literatures on tariff reform before  
1914 and the adoption of the general tariff in the 1930s, few writers have attempted to link  
these issues to the debates over de-industrialisation and “globalisation” since the 1970s. This  
paper uses a data set covering the long period from 1870 to 2000, adopting an explicit  
quantitative approach to facilitate comparisons between sub-periods. Particular attention is  
paid to the contribution of different sectors to Britain‟s comparative productivity  
performance, since misleading conclusions can be drawn from a consideration of only part of  
the economy. 
Sections II and III set out the broad trends in productivity performance and the degree  
of openness of the British economy during the period 1870-2000. Although debates over  
protection often make reference to different sectors of the economy, most international  
comparisons of productivity work only in terms of aggregate productivity measures. Here, we  

========3========

draw on the data presented in Broadberry (1998) to examine the links between openness and  
productivity performance at the sectoral level. Although Britain was overtaken by the United  
States during the 1890s and by Germany during the 1960s, the sectoral patterns of changing  
productivity performance are very different from those emphasised in the conventional  
literature. In particular, we point to the importance of the later structural shift out of  
agriculture in the United States and Germany and to overtaking in services rather than in  
industry. In all three countries, trends in openness followed a U-shaped pattern with high  
levels of openness before World War I and after World War II, separated by a protectionist  
interlude. However, whereas the pre-World War I level of openness was surpassed by the  
1970s in Germany and by the early 1980s in the United States, this was not the case in  
Britain, even by 1990. 
Sections IV to VI consider shorter periods in the light of the long run evidence, paying  
particular attention to sectoral issues. First, we see that as a result of the openness of the  
British economy, agriculture was unusually small in nineteenth century Britain, allowing  
resources to be deployed in the higher value added industrial and service sectors. This benefit  
of openness is rarely considered alongside the costs to British industry of retaining open  
markets when tariffs were being raised against British exports. Second, many writers criticise  
the cosmopolitan service sector for neglecting domestic industry. However, this ignores the  
importance of the outward orientation of services for service sector productivity, and the  
growing importance of services for productivity performance overall. Third, the trend of  
British industrial performance was not improved by protection when it was applied in the  
1930s, despite the claims of the tariff reformers. Furthermore, protective attempts to avoid de- 
industrialisation after World War II had an adverse effect on productivity performance in  
industry and in the aggregate economy.

II. BRITAIN’S LONG RUN PRODUCTIVITY PERFORMANCE 
Table 1 presents sectoral estimates of comparative labour productivity levels for the US/UK  
and Germany/UK cases over the period 1870-2000, derived from Broadberry (1997b; 1997c;  
1998; 2006). The United States and Germany were Britain‟s main trading rivals during most  
of this period. The concept of labour productivity used here is output per person engaged. For  
the whole economy, labour productivity in the United States was about 90 per cent of the  
British level in 1870, and the United States overtook Britain as the aggregate labour  
productivity leader during the 1890s and continued to forge ahead to the 1950s. Since then,  
there has been a slow process of British catching-up, but by 1990 there was still a substantial  
aggregate Anglo-American labour productivity gap of more than 30 per cent, which increased  
again during the second half of the 1990s, as US productivity surged with the diffusion of  
ICT (Jorgenson and Stiroh, 2000). Turning to the Germany/UK comparison, for the whole  
economy, German labour productivity in 1871 was about 60 per cent of the British level, and  
had still reached only about 75 per cent of the British level by World War I.  After a setback  
across the war, Germany again reached about 75 per cent of the British level by the mid- 
1930s, rising to about 80 per cent by the late 1930s. After another setback across World War  
II, Germany continued to catch-up, overtook Britain only during the mid-1960s and by 1979 
had a labour productivity advantage of more than 25 per cent. However, this German  
advantage has been much reduced during the 1980s and 1990s. 
The sectoral patterns of comparative productivity performance are quite varied. Here  
the nine-sector analysis provided in Broadberry (1998) has been simplified onto a three-sector  
basis, distinguishing between agriculture, industry and services, as in Broadberry and Ghosal  
(2002) and Broadberry (2005). Industry includes mineral extraction, manufacturing,  

========5========

5 
construction and the utilities, while services includes transport and communications,  
distribution, finance, professional and personal services and government. Both Germany and  
the United States caught-up with and overtook Britain in terms of aggregate labour  
productivity largely by shifting resources out of agriculture and improving their comparative  
productivity performance in services rather than by improving their comparative productivity  
performance in industry (Broadberry, 1998). 
Broadberry (1993) first established that comparative labour productivity in  
manufacturing has remained stationary in both the US/UK and the Germany/UK cases since  
the late nineteenth century, and Table 1 shows that this result generalises to industry as a  
whole. By contrast, in both cases the aggregate labour productivity ratio moves broadly in line  
with the labour productivity ratio for services. Although both Germany and the United States  
have improved their labour productivity performance relative to Britain in agriculture, there  
has also been a dramatic decline in the importance of agriculture, which can be seen in Table  
2. Whereas in 1870 agriculture accounted for about half of all employment in Germany and  
the United States, by 1999 this had fallen to under three per cent. The shift out of agriculture  
has nevertheless had an important impact on comparative productivity performance at the  
aggregate level. This is because in the late nineteenth century Britain already had a much  
smaller share of the labour force in agriculture, which has had a substantially lower value  
added per employee than in industry or services. Hence the large share of resources tied up in  
agriculture in the United States exercised a significant negative influence on the aggregate US  
productivity performance relative to Britain in the late nineteenth and early twentieth  
centuries, and as the importance of agriculture declined this negative influence was removed.  
Similarly, the relatively large share of resources in German agriculture had a negative effect  
on Germany‟s aggregate productivity performance relative to Britain until after World War II.  

========6========

Note that Germany in 1950 had a bigger share of the labour force in agriculture than Britain  
in 1871.1 
The labour productivity di 
fferences in Table 1 may be explained in part by differences  
in capital intensity. So before we turn to measures of openness, it will be useful to provide  
estimates of comparative levels of total factor productivity (TFP), where TFP measures the  
productivi 
ty of labour and physical capital, weighted by their respective shares in income. 
2 
Comparing Table 3 with Table 1, we see that although capital explains a part of the labour  
productivity differences between the three countries, it is not sufficient to elim 
inate  
differences in TFP, some of which may be explained by openness.  
For the US/UK case, trends in comparative TFP and labour productivity at the  
aggregate level are similar, but with TFP differences generally smaller than labour  
productivity differenc 
es. One point worth noting here is that whereas the United States  
overtook Britain before World War I in terms of labour productivity, it was only between the  
wars that the United States gained a TFP advantage. This would be consistent with the  
emphasis of 
Abramovitz and David (1973; 1996) on the importance of capital rather than TFP  
in American economic growth during the nineteenth century. It is also consistent with  
McCloskey‟s (1970) claim that Victorian Britain did not fail, in the sense that the United 
States was still catching-up in terms of aggregate TFP levels. In services, too, note that US  
overtaking of Britain also occurred later in terms of TFP than in terms of labour productivity.  
For the Germany/UK case, again comparing Tables 1 and 3 we see that trends are very similar  
                                                  
1 
Conventional shift-share analysis fails to capture the importance of structural change because it is based on the  assumption that the high rates of productivity growth in the shrinking agricultural sector would still have been  achieved even if labour had not left the sector. See Broadberry (1998) for an alternative calculation. 
2The share of capital declines from 
0.4 before World War I to 0.25 after World War II. These shares are derived  
from Matthews et al. (1982), Kendrick (1961) and Hoffmann (1965).

for comparative TFP and labour productivity at the aggregate level, with differences in TFP  
generally smaller than differences in labour productivity. Note that in industry, Germany had  
caught up with Britain in terms of TFP as well as labour productivity before World War I. 
III. TRENDS IN OPENNESS 
1. International trade and protection 
The most commonly used measures of the degree of openness are the shares of imports and  
exports in GDP. Trade ratios can be calculated both for goods and for goods and services. For  
the United Kingdom, the figures in Table 4 show a period of increasing openness before  
World War I, while trade ratios declined during the period between the wars. The early post- 
World War II period, although relatively open compared to the interwar period did not match  
the degree of openness seen before World War I. Even by the late 1980s, the British export  
trade ratios had not regained their pre-1914 levels. 
Since we shall be concerned with Britain‟s policies and performance in an  
international context, it will be helpful to consider the trade ratios in the United States and  
Germany, Britain‟s main trading rivals over most of this period. In both Germany and the  
United States, trade ratios declined between the wars and rose again after World War II. In  
contrast to Britain, however, the pre-World War I degree of openness was decisively  
surpassed, by the 1970s in the case of Germany and by the 1980s in the case of the United  
States.    This is also true for trade in goods compared with GDP in goods production which,  
given the rise of non-tradable services over time, is sometimes regarded as a better indicator  
(Feenstra, 1998). 

========8========

8 
It is natural to link the U-shaped pattern of the trade ratios to changes in the level of  
protection. Figures on the ratio of duties to total imports are given in Table 5. Although this  
ratio gives an imperfect measure of changes in tariff rates, most writers find that it captures  
the broad movements (Capie, 1994: 31-32). For Britain, it is necessary to exclude revenue- 
raising duties on tobacco and petroleum to obtain an accurate picture of the pattern of  
protection, particularly since World War II. The trend towards free trade in Britain during the  
nineteenth century is clearly visible, using both the total and adjusted customs revenue to  
import value ratios. The retreat from free trade in the interwar period is equally clear,  
culminating in the General Tariff of 1932. For the post-World War II period, however, it is  
important to remove the customs duties on tobacco and petroleum, which should not be seen  
as protective (Lindert, 1991). Then the return to openness is more apparent. 
For the United States, data are available on the ratio of duties to dutiable imports, as  
well as the ratio of duties to total imports. Although the former ratio is somewhat higher, the  
trend is very similar to that for the ratio of duties to total imports. A declining level of  
protection in the first half of the nineteenth century was sharply reversed during the Civil War  
decade, and although there was a further downward drift in the level during the period 1870- 
1913, protection remained high by international standards before World War I. The United  
States remained protectionist between the wars, with the Fordney-McCumber and Hawley- 
Smoot tariffs of 1922 and 1930, respectively, before becoming increasingly liberal under the  
GATT system during the post-World War II period. 
German data on the ratio of customs duties to total imports are given in Table 5 for  
the period after the formation of the German Reich. Although there was a small increase  
during the 1880s, the degree of protection was much closer to the British than to the  

========9========

9 
American level. Alternative data on the unweighted average level of duties confirm that the  
scale of the retreat from free trade in Continental Europe towards the end of the nineteenth  
century should not be exaggerated (Liepmann, 1938). Thus, for example, Capie (1983: 26)  
reports an average ad valorem rate of duty of 8.4 per cent for Germany in 1910. The rise of  
protectionism in Germany between the wars, particularly with the growth of bilateralism  
under the Third Reich, is clearly visible in Table 5. Equally clear is the firm embrace of a  
liberal trading policy after World War II. Given the strong trading links with other European  
countries, European integration via the EEC has resulted in very low ratios of customs duties  
to imports in Germany. However, Weiss (1988) offers a qualification to this view, noting the  
growth of subsidies to a number of German industries, thus to some extent undermining the  
liberal regime (Giersch et al., 1992). 
2. Trade blocs 
In this section we examine trends in British exports to see how Britain came to be  
increasingly dependent on Empire markets between the late nineteenth century and the mid- 
twentieth century. The key factor was the growth of protectionism in the United States and  
Germany during the late nineteenth century, which before World War I culminated in a  
division of the world into spheres of influence by the three major manufacturing countries  
(Taussig, 1892; Schlote, 1952; Hoffman, 1933). A survey of many of the pre-1914  
international combines is given in Plummer (1951: 4-10). The chemical industry was one of  
the most prone to international combination, with formal agreements in alkalis and  
explosives. As Reader (1970: 60) puts it, "In deciding how to share markets, the principle  
generally followed in each group, was that the British member...... should have the markets of  
Great Britain and the British Empire; the European member or members, Europe. Markets  
elsewhere in the world were a matter for negotiation. The USA, the richest, stood alone by  

========10========

10 
reason of the formidable nature of the natives. Latin America, where both British and  
European connections were strong, was apt to be looked upon by American companies,  
particularly in the explosives trade, as being covered by a businessman's version of the  
Monroe Doctrine......... For the purposes of market-sharing the Russian Empire was generally  
taken as a province of Europe and the Chinese as a dependency of the British." 
The upshot of these trends was a clear move towards concentration by British  
producers on Empire markets from the late nineteenth century. Furthermore, as Schlote's  
(1952) data in Part A of Table 6 show, this was a new departure, since there was no clear  
upward trend in the Empire share of British exports between 1830 and 1870. The trend  
towards concentration on Empire markets, particularly the Dominions of Australia, New  
Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Canada and Newfoundland, accelerated in the interwar  
period. The upheaval in the British trade data caused by the independence of the Irish Free  
State does not affect these trends, since the share can be calculated on both the old and the  
new basis in Parts A and B of Table 6. Continuing to 1990 in Part B of Table 6, the share of  
British exports to the original six members of the EEC as well as the share to “British  
countries” can be seen. Clearly the rise to dominance of Empire markets (peaking at 55% in  
1951) was the other side of a serious decline in the importance of Continental European  
markets during the interwar and transwar periods. Imperial Preference was clearly no small  
sideshow for the British economy in the twentieth century. Indeed, as Drummond (1974: 426)  
notes, Imperial economic matters took up more Cabinet time than any other aspect of  
economic affairs between the wars. As late as 1970, more British exports were going to  
“British countries” than to the EEC. Since Britain joined the EEC in 1973, however, trade  
with “British countries” (including the Republic of South Africa and the Irish Republic) has  
dramatically declined in importance. 

========11========

11 
3. The protectionist period 
Although the highest levels of protection for the UK economy were seen in the 1940s, it is  
important to recognise that protectionism was quite significant until the late 1970s.  
Protectionism was the order of the day throughout the years when relative economic decline 
was at its peak. Table 7 underlines the slowness of the retreat from protectionist policies in  
three ways.  First, it is shown that in the late 1950s, virtually across the whole manufacturing  
sector tariffs were considerably higher than in West Germany.  Second, we see that average  
tariff rates for UK manufacturing were still as high in the early 1960s as they had been in the  
1930s.  Third, a measure of trade costs relating to UK-France and UK-Germany trade flows is  
seen to have remained above the 1929 level until the 1970s.  The 1970s fall in trade costs was  
driven by trade liberalization; had this taken place earlier, for example, through accession to  
the EEC at the Treaty of Rome, trade costs could have been below the 1929 level much  
earlier. 
IV. FREE TRADE BRITAIN, 1870-1914 
Before 1914, Britain‟s continued commitment to openness despite growing restrictions  
abroad had beneficial effects on aggregate productivity performance through the shift of  
resources out of low value added agriculture and high productivity in Britain‟s cosmopolitan  
commercial and financial service sectors. These factors are rarely given sufficient weight in  
the literature on British growth, which focuses on the difficulties faced by British industry as  
a result of tariffs faced in foreign markets and dumping by foreign producers in the British  
market. This section will consider in turn the situation in industry, agriculture and services  
before turning to an aggregate perspective. 
1. Industry 

========12========

12 
The disadvantage faced by British industry in foreign markets on the eve of World War I is  
easily demonstrated in Table 8. Part A shows ad valorem tariff rates on a number of British  
exports in 1903. The countries are listed in descending order of the degree of protection, as  
measured by the weighted average tariff rate across 31 commodites, using British export  
weights. The average tariff faced by British industrial exporters ranged from 131 per cent in  
Russia to 3 percent in the Netherlands. Part B is taken from Grunzel‟s (1916) study of tariffs  
on a multilateral basis in 1913, with tariffs presented in terms of German marks per hundred  
kilograms. An average of tariffs on this basis would not be meaningful, but it is clear from the  
ordering of countries for individual commodities that the averages in Part A, based on British  
export prices and values, do indeed broadly reflect the multilateral situation. The United  
States was clearly a country with very high industrial tariffs, Germany was moderately  
protective and Britain was a free trade country. Notice also from Part B that Germany had a  
high tariff on wheat, the key agricultural product, a theme that will be taken up in the next  
section. 
2. Agriculture 
Although the fact that free traders in nineteenth century Britain pointed to the benefit to  
consumers of cheap grain prices arising from free trade in corn has been widely noted, the  
implications for productivity in domestic agriculture have not really been spelled out (Imlah,  
1958: 145-146). In Britain, the main impact of the grain invasion from the New World was a  
shift of the product mix away from grain towards higher value-added pastoral products,  
coupled with higher capital intensity in what remained of the British arable farming sector (Ó  
Gráda, 1994: 149-156; Brown, 1987: 25-26, 33).  As a result, the high levels of labour  
productivity that already characterised British agriculture during the Industrial Revolution  
were raised still further, and the relatively small British agricultural sector continued to  

========13========

13 
achieve output per worker levels on a par with the United States before World War I. The  
highest levels of labour productivity were recorded in the parts of the New World  
concentrating on pastoral products, especially Australia, New Zealand and Argentina (Rostas,  
1948: 80). In much of continental Europe, however, the response to the grain invasion from  
the New World was an intensification of agricultural protection from the 1870s to World War  
I (Bairoch, 1989: 51-69). With grain prices maintained artificially high by tariff barriers, low  
productivity continental farmers were able to remain in business. Given the weight of  
agriculture in overall economic activity at the time, this had important consequences for  
aggregate productivity performance which lasted well into the post-World War II period. 
3. Services 
One of the outstanding features of the period between the mid-nineteenth century and World  
War I was the emergence of Britain as the centre of the world system of trade and payments.  
As a result, Britain‟s cosmopolitan service sector generated between 20 and 25 per cent of  
total exports between 1870 and 1913, as can be seen in Table 4. The major service sectors  
generating exports were transport and communications (particularly shipping), distribution  
(particularly wholesale merchanting) and financial services (particularly insurance and  
merchant banking). Imlah (1958: 70-75) provides figures on the net credits generated by these  
three sectors, which made a substantial contribution to the current account of the balance of  
payments, fluctuating between about 7 and 9 per cent of GDP. For Germany, by contrast, the  
much smaller and less productive service sector generated a net surplus on the current account 
of 2 to 3 per cent of GDP.3 
                                                  3 
Figures from Hoffmann (1965: 817, 825-826). 

========14========

14 
The openness and cosmopolitanism of the British service sector has nevertheless been  
seen traditionally as a problem in much of the literature on British economic growth, which is  
heavily oriented towards manufacturing. Perhaps the most obvious manifestation of this view  
is the claim that domestic manufacturing industry was starved of capital as a result of  
cosmopolitan financiers based in the City of London directing British savings overseas  
(Kennedy, 1987; Best and Humphries, 1986). Whilst Collins (1990; 1998) provides many  
reasons to be sceptical of this view, we note here two points which have received insufficient  
attention in the literature. First, value added per employee was relatively high in financial  
services, so that Britain‟s large and specialised financial service sector made a positive direct  
contribution to Britain‟s overall productivity position.    Second, the marketed services sector  
including finance was the one in which Britain‟s productivity relative to Germany and the  
United States was strongest in the period leading up to World War I (Broadberry, 2006: 37,  
48). 
4. An aggregate perspective 
A number of writers have pointed to a systematic negative relationship between openness and  
growth in this period (Bairoch, 1989; Jacks, 2006; O‟Rourke, 2000) although this remains  
open to question depending on the methodology and sample used (Schularick and Solomou,  
2009; Tena-Junguito, 2009).  This might seem to indicate that the UK would have been well- 
served by discarding free-trade policies in favour of the protection that was the norm in  
Continental Europe. 
         There are, however, a number of reasons to be sceptical of making this inference.  First,  
a closer analysis suggests that, at best, it is only tariffs on manufacturing and not on  
agriculture that are correlated with growth (Lehmann and O‟Rourke, 2008) yet the politics of  

========15========

15 
protectionism in Europe was based on coalitions that protected both sectors.  In Germany,  
agriculture was much more heavily protected than manufacturing with tariff revenue relative  
to imports at 12% (UK = 1%) compared with 5% (UK = 3%).  Second, the case for protecting  
manufacturing was surely strongest in a context of infant industries and capital market failure.   
This does not fit well with the UK at this time (Michie, 1988) and, as noted above, Britain  
was not in fact falling behind in terms of manufacturing labour productivity before World  
War I. The long-standing transatlantic labour productivity gap in manufacturing was  
stationary between 1870 and 1913 and no other European country was substantially ahead of  
Britain by 1913 (Broadberry, 1997a: 52-57). In any event, the tariff proposals that were made  
by Chamberlain would have tended to divert activity toward traditional sectors such as  
agriculture and textiles rather than new growth industries (Thomas, 1984) and tariff  
protection was irrelevant to the services sector which was the locus of American out- 
performance in productivity growth (Irwin, 2001). 
         Third, and most important, the long-run effects of free trade on the level of income in the  
UK are likely to have been substantial and positive.  In the recent past the strongest evidence  
of a positive effect of openness on the level of income was provided by Frankel and Romer  
(1999) later confirmed by Feyrer (2009) in a paper which deals very well with the  
identification problem.  Jacks (2006) found that similar but rather stronger results are also  
obtained for the 19th century.  Table 9 reports the implications of this analysis for the UK 
compared with Germany, namely, that the much lower trade exposure of Germany resulting  
from the protectionist coalition implied a substantial income loss. 
These results make sense in the context of Anglo-German productivity comparisons.  
As noted in Broadberry (1997c), Germany had caught up with Britain in all industrial sectors  

========16========

16 
before World War I, but German aggregate labour productivity nevertheless remained at  
about three-quarters of the British level. This can be explained in part by low productivity in  
German services, but agriculture played a more important part since:  (1) the productivity gap  
was larger in agriculture than in services; (2) agriculture accounted for a larger share of  
employment than services; (3) value added per employee was lower in agriculture than in  
services.  Openness promoted a shift out of agriculture into higher value-added services in the  
UK; protection obstructed this in Germany. 
V. PROTECTION AND IMPERIAL PREFERENCE, 1914-1950 
Once again, the conventional analysis focuses on industry and neglects the implications for  
agriculture and services. Protectionism was accompanied by a policy of imperial preference,  
which had a significant impact on the geographical orientation of British business activity, in  
services as well as in industry. This was to create difficulties of adjustment when the world  
economy reintegrated after World War II. As for the pre-1914 period, it will be useful to  
consider industry, agriculture and services in turn. 
1. Industry 
Kitson and Solomou (1990) accept the conventional view that protectionism was bad for the  
world economy as a whole between the wars, but make the more limited claim that the British  
adoption of a general tariff in 1932 was a second best policy given the extent of protectionism  
abroad. One issue concerns the impact of the tariff on the level of economic activity. A  
cyclical recovery would be expected to have had beneficial effects on productivity in the short  
run, since employment lagged behind output in the economic cycle.4 However, the more

Although the direction of the effect is not in dispute, it is likely that Kitson and Solomou (1990) overstate its  magnitude. Since the tariff was imposed after Britain left the gold standard, any improvement in the balance of  

========17========

17 
striking claim made by Kitson and Solomou (1990: 10-16) is that the tariff caused an increase  
in the trend rate of growth. An obvious difficulty with this argument can be seen in Table 10;  
growth of GDP was faster during the 1920s than during the 1930s.5 Even if attention is  
confined to industrial production, the acceleration of growth in the 1930s is surely insufficient  
to warrant claims of a c 
hange in trend. However, Kitson and Solomou (1990: 12) argue that  
the high growth of the 1920s was just a cyclical phenomenon bringing the economy back to  
the trend for the period 1899 
-1929. So although actual growth did not increase during the  
1930s relat 
ive to the 1920s, Kitson and Solomou nevertheless see an increase in trend growth  
during the 1930s relative to the trend for the longer period 1899 
-1929. This can be seen in  
Table 10 
for compromise GDP as well as for industrial production. However, the arg 
ument is  
obviously highly dependent on the periodisation imposed on the data. If a break in trend is  
tested for rather than imposed, the Kitson and Solomou claim is easily rejected. For industrial  
production over the period 1879 
-1938, Greasley and Oxley (1 
996) find a break in trend at  
1920 and crashes at 1914 and 1920, but reject a break in trend at 1929. For GDP, Mills  
(1991) finds a major regime shift only after the deep recession of 1921.  
Was the interwar tariff good for productivity performance in Bri 
tish manufacturing?  
Kitson and Solomou (1990) suggest that it was, at least, in the short term, and they report that  
labour productivity growth in industries that were newly 
-protected in 1932 showed an  
increase of 2.28 percentage points in 1930 
-5 relative  
to 1924 
-30 compared with 0.03  
percentage points in the non 
-newly protected industries. 
                                                                                                                                                           trade brought about by the tariff may be expected to have caused exchange rate appreciation, offsetting the  competitive gain from the tariff (Broadberry, 1986: 132-138). 
5 
Kitson and Solomou (1990: 11) report figures for 1925 -29 rather than the conventional peak -to -peak period  1924 -29; this has the effect of showing the growth rate of compromise GD P at 2.0 per cent per annum during  
both the 1920s and the 1930s. The explanation given for the unconventional choice of dates is that “1924 is far  too close to the 1921 depression to be regarded as a peak year in economic activity.” (Kitson and Solomou,  1990: 11).  

========18========

18 
         Table 11 revisits this analysis.  We look at a 3-way division of industries into those  
which were protected before 1932 through the McKenna and Key Industry duties, industries  
which received a new tariff of at least 20 per cent under the 1932 Import Duties Act, and  
industries which either received no protection or the general ad valorem duty of 10 per cent  
(and were generally not exposed to import competition) based on the information given in  
Hutchinson (1965) and Sebag-Montefiore (1943).    We also consider longer-run differences in  
productivity growth by comparing 1935-48 with 1924-35 since this is likely to reveal any  
adverse effects of reduced competition on managerial incentives to control costs. 
         The results in Table 11 show that granting additional protection in 1932 had a positive  
but statistically insignificant effect on productivity growth in the short run and a negligible  
impact in the longer run.    Interestingly, the difference in productivity growth for 1935-48  
compared with 1924-35 is significantly negative for industries that had experienced a  
prolonged period of protection suggesting that they may have been in the comfort zone for too  
long. Contrary to Kitson and Solomou (1990), there is nothing here to suggest that protection  
was a policy conducive to improved productivity performance. 
2. Agriculture 
It is worth noting that the strategic justification for protecting agriculture in peacetime so as to  
secure food supplies during war did not prove to be of much value during the twentieth  
century. As Olson (1963: 138-140) notes, it was Germany rather than Britain that succumbed  
to blockade during World War I. Olson (1963: 138-139) points to the ability of the British  
agricultural sector to expand output on the stored-up fertility of grasslands brought back into  
arable use compared with the inability of German agriculture to maintain output at full stretch  

========19========

19 
in the face of wartime disruption. However, Olson (1963: 146) also stresses the flexibility of  
the British service sector through administration as well as distribution as the decisive factor. 
One factor behind the increase of arable output in Britain during World War I was a  
system of guaranteed minimum prices set under the Corn Production Act of 1917. If market  
prices fell below the minimum for the following six years, farmers were to receive deficiency  
payments equal to the difference between the market and minimum prices on the volume of  
output that they produced (Whetham, 1978: 94-95). The system was extended for an  
indefinite term in the Agriculture Act of 1920, but when agricultural prices suddenly  
collapsed the legislation was hastily repealed in 1921 in what became known in farming  
circles as the “Great Betrayal” (Whetham, 1978: 139-141). Apart from a system of beet sugar  
subsidies introduced in 1924, there were few measures to protect agriculture during the  
1920s, which continued to be a difficult time for British farmers, particularly arable  
producers. During the 1930s, however, a wider range of protective measures was introduced  
as prices collapsed still further. Although tariffs and quotas were used in some cases, support  
for agriculture generally took the form of subsidies and marketing schemes. This was partly  
as a result of government desires to keep food prices low, but it also reflected the policy of  
imperial preference. If Britain was to obtain access to Empire markets for industrial exports,  
then Empire farmers had to have access to the British market for agricultural produce. Hence  
Brown (1987: 118) sees protection as a great disappointment to British farmers.  
As during World War I, Britain was able to survive blockade by Germany during  
World War II (Olson, 1963: 140). During the later 1930s, as the prospect of war approached,  
the government made preparations for the expansion of agricultural output, and this was  
achieved much more rapidly during World War II than during World War I (Brown, 1987:  

========20========

20 
125-146). Again, it was the possibility of expansion on the grasslands combined with the  
flexibility of the British service sector that proved decisive (Olson, 1963: 146). 
3. Services 
Most accounts of inter-war British economic history emphasise the detrimental effects of the  
return to the gold standard at the pre-war parity in 1925. The openness and outward  
orientation of the financial services sector is usually seen as the driving force behind this  
decision, while industry is seen as bearing the costs of the overvalued exchange rate that  
resulted. The costs of the overvalued exchange rate have been the subject of much debate,  
with a number of studies attempting a quantitative evaluation (Moggridge, 1972; Broadberry,  
1986). However, the benefits for productivity of an outward oriented service sector are not  
usually considered in such studies; this gives the literature a bias towards industry. However,  
as we have seen in Table 1, it is the loss of productivity leadership in services that mirrors  
most closely Britain‟s overall loss of productivity leadership.  
An important motivating factor behind the return to gold was a widespread belief in  
the City that Britain‟s prosperity depended on resurrecting the pre-war liberal international  
financial and trading systems (Pollard, 1970). The downward spiral following the onset of the  
Great Depression in 1929 clearly put an end to such hopes, but there were sufficient signs of a  
revival in the commercial bill acceptance market and new capital issues during the 1920s to  
suggest that such hopes were not completely without foundation (Ellinger, 1940: 374; Balogh, 
1947, 249-250; Broadberry, 2007: 268-272). Furthermore, it is clear that the collapse of the  
liberal world economic order had a much greater negative impact on the highly globalised  
British economy than on either the domestically oriented US economy or the more highly  
protectionist German economy of the pre-1914 period. The response of the British economy  

========21========

21 
to these events was a growing integration within the British Empire, which although possibly  
beneficial in the short run, created long run costs of adjustment. 
It should be stressed that the above argument is not intended to deny the costs  
imposed by the exchange rate overvaluation, which arose from a perception that the influence  
of the City of London would be best maintained by a return to gold at pre-war parity.  
However, it does suggest that ex-ante there was also a positive side to the balance sheet,  
which should not be neglected.    Had the return to gold been part of a successful re- 
establishment of a globalised world economy rather than the precursor of a globalisation  
backlash, Britain would have gained from expansion of its internationally-oriented market  
services. 
4. The legacy of interwar protectionism 
It is important to recognise that the protectionist 1930s cast a long shadow over the post-war  
period in Britain.  Oulton (1976: 81) claimed that “the schedule of effective tariffs in the  
1960s can therefore be regarded as largely the product of the economic, social and political  
stresses of    World War I and the great depression” given the similarity with the 1930s.  This  
is perhaps an overstatement but there is quite a high correlation, as Table 12 reveals; only in  
the 1970s does this evaporate completely.  Clearly, once put in place, the political economy of  
protectionism generates persistence. 
         This had unfortunate implications for productivity performance through the impact that  
protectionism had in sustaining market power.  Price-cost margins were very high in post-war  
British manufacturing until the trade liberalization of the 1970s (Crafts and Mills, 2009).   
There is clear evidence that in the early post-war period the weakness of competition  

========22========

22 
contributed to productivity problems and relative economic decline (Broadberry and Crafts,  
1996; Symeonidis, 2008).  This is to be expected given that UK firms were exceptionally  
prone to problems arising from the separation of ownership and control to which greater  
competition could have been an important antidote.    Not surprisingly, Proudman and Redding  
(1998) found that openness and productivity growth were positively correlated across  
manufacturing sectors after 1970. 
Kitson and Solomou (1990) stop their analysis at the end of the 1930s, but note in the  
very brief conclusion to their book that the tariff may have prevented the necessary structural  
change that would have accelerated economic growth after World War II.  Quite so. The same  
may be said of the policy of imperial preference. We have already seen in Table 6 that by the  
end of World War II more than half of Britain‟s exports were going to Empire markets, and  
for some industries the Empire share of Britain‟s exports was more than three-quarters.6 This  
may be seen as helping to maintain the level of economic activity in the short run 
, but  
creating problems of adjustment in the long run. 
The trans 
-World War II period saw an increase in the share of the labour force  
employed in agriculture and industry, which went against the trend since the mid 
-nineteenth  
century. Within the context o 
f a controlled economy,  
both capital and 
labour inputs were  
directed into manufacturing, mining and agriculture on strategic grounds. Yet, as Matthews et  
al. (1982: 235 
-236) point out, the increase in total factor input growth was offset by a  
decrease in T 
FP growth, suggesting a tendency to diminishing returns.  
VI. BRITAIN IN THE WORLD ECONOMY, 1950-2000 

========23========

23 
Protection for industry and agriculture continued after World War II. The proportion of the  
labour force in manufacturing continued to rise until 1960, as post-war governments sought to  
encourage exports and avoid balance of payments problems while maintaining a fixed  
exchange rate (Matthews et al., 1982: 221). Many restrictions on openness, including quotas,  
tariffs and exchange controls, were needed to maintain external equilibrium with the over- 
expanded agricultural and industrial sectors (Foreman-Peck, 1991).  
As the world economy reintegrated on a liberal basis, particularly from about 1960,  
British industry faced major problems of adjustment. As well as an inevitable reduction in the  
share of the labour force devoted to industry, there were adjustment costs in switching from  
Commonwealth to European markets. However, the process of adjustment has had benefits as  
well as costs. As productivity growth in manufacturing accelerated during the 1980s, and as  
output and employment expanded rapidly in services, the long period of British relative  
economic decline came to an end. Furthermore, as the European economy became more  
integrated, economies of scale and standardisation helped to reduce the transatlantic  
productivity gaps in industry and services. Although agricultural protection has remained high  
under the Common Agricultural Policy, with adverse consequences for food prices,  
agriculture is now too small a part of the economy for this to have a major impact on  
productivity in the economy as a whole. 
1. Industry 
Matthews et al. (1982: 235-236) point to the slowing down of TFP growth despite the  
increase in the growth of total factor input during the trans-World War II period as evidence  
of diminishing returns in manufacturing. Similarly, in mineral extraction, TFP growth became  
                                                                                                                                                           6 
In 1948, this was the case for fertilisers, cotton cloth, hosiery, carpets, tobacco and glass. 

========24========

24 
negative as the movement of inputs out of the sector slowed down. It is perhaps not  
surprising, then, that during the early post-war period the over-extended manufacturing and  
mineral extraction sectors required protection. In the coal industry, import licences were  
granted only to the state-owned National Coal Board for use at times when home production  
fell short of demand (Ashworth, 1986: 47). In addition, the coal industry received substantial  
financial support while its major customers, the electricity supply and gas industries, were  
required to burn more coal than warranted by purely economic considerations (Buxton, 1978:  
239). In manufacturing, the early post-war period was characterised by the widespread use of  
import quotas, while the rationing of key inputs such as steel helped to direct resources  
towards export industries (Foreman-Peck, 1991: 159-160; Dow, 1965: 153-162). As controls  
were removed in line with a return to a more liberal world trading environment, the British  
economy continually ran into balance of payments problems. In 1964 the incoming Labour  
government imposed a surcharge on manufactured imports in an ultimately unsuccessful  
attempt to avoid devaluation (Foreman-Peck, 1991: 161). They also imposed a selective  
employment tax (SET) to encourage labour into industrial rather than service sector  
employment (Cairncross, 1992: 158-159). 
British industry faced additional difficulties during the early post-war period arising  
from the legacy of imperial preference policies adopted between the wars. Just when  
investment in marketing and after-sales service was becoming more important, British  
industry found itself oriented towards distant markets in which Britain had secured a strong  
position only through preferential treatment. Sometimes, the preferential treatment was  
rapidly withdrawn after World War II. In the motor vehicle industry, for example, high tariffs  
in Australia effectively closed off Britain‟s most important inter-war market, while exchange  
controls made it difficult to invest in adequate marketing and after-sales service in  

========25========

25 
Continental Europe (Whisler, 1994: 5). Since spare parts were not included in export quotas,  
serious damage was done to the reputation of British cars in this important market (Dunnett,  
1980: 37). In Table 6 we see that during the 1960s there was a dramatic decline in the share of  
British exports going to Commonwealth markets, which were overtaken in importance by the  
EEC during the 1970s. 
The decision to join the EEC in 1973 together with the Kennedy Round of the GATT  
accelerated the process of increasing openness. However, as the process of de- 
industrialisation also threatened to accelerate during the 1970s, governments continued to  
protect industry through industrial policies that effectively subsidised “lame ducks”  
(Millward, 1994: 163-165).    The evidence regarding these interventionist policies is that they  
slowed down much-needed structural adjustment.  The picture is that “it was losers like Rolls    
Royce, British Leyland and Alfred Herbert who picked ministers… What was described as  
„picking winners‟ appeared in practice to amount to spending large sums shoring up ailing  
companies” (Morris and Stout, 1985: 873). 
        This policy changed under the Conservative governments of the 1980s, with dramatic  
effects on both the size of the industrial sector and its productivity performance. As  
employment in manufacturing shrank by about 2 million between 1979 and 1989, labour  
productivity growth accelerated to 4.2 per cent per annum after stagnating at 0.7 per cent per  
annum during the previous cycle, 1973-1979 (Broadberry, 2004). Table 13 shows the  
dramatic turn-round of British productivity performance relative to Germany in a number of  
industries, notably aerospace, iron and steel, and motor vehicles, the last two of which had  
seen heavy protection removed during the 1970s.  More generally, a difference-in-differences  

========26========

26 
analysis of productivity growth before and after 1979, reported in Table 14, suggests that the  
removal of such protection had a favourable impact on productivity performance. 
2. Agriculture 
Whereas the encouragement of agricultural production during World War I was followed by  
the virtual elimination of support during the “Great Betrayal” of 1921, World War II was  
followed by the reinforcement of support in the 1947 Agriculture Act (Holderness, 1985: 12- 
13). However, the British system of agricultural protection did not involve the sacrifice of low 
food prices for consumers. Building on the pre-war schemes, farmers received deficiency  
payments when market prices fell below guaranteed prices. This was less damaging than the  
variable levy system, which raises the price to consumers as well as producers (El-Agraa,  
1994: 212-214). However, Britain adopted the Common Agricultural Policy of the EEC in  
1973, based upon the variable levy system. The scale of support for agriculture during the  
1970s and 1980s was considerable, and this can be seen in the return of Britain to self- 
sufficiency in many agricultural products. Even in wheat, where imports accounted for 77  
percent of consumption in 1936-39, imports had fallen to 23 per cent of consumption by  
1980-81 (Holderness, 1985: 174). Nevertheless, agriculture is now such a small part of the  
economy that its impact on the overall level of productivity is relatively insignificant. 
3. Services 
As during the inter-war period, the outward orientation of the financial service sector has  
often been seen as a disadvantage during the post-war period. Pollard (1984: 85-88) argues  
that during the Bretton Woods era, the desire to retain an international role for sterling led to  
an overvalued exchange rate, which undermined the competitiveness of British industry. This  
echoes his views on the inter-war period, where he emphasises the costs to industry of the  

========27========

27 
return to gold in 1925 at pre-war parity, but ignores the importance of high productivity in  
services for Britain‟s overall productivity performance. In fact, international financial services  
is one of the few sectors where Britain has retained a strong competitive position (Smith,  
1992). In many other parts of the service sector Britain‟s performance has been  
undistinguished, and it is the deterioration of comparative productivity performance in  
services that accounts for much of Britain‟s relative economic decline overall. Since large  
parts of the service sector have been relatively closed to international competition, it is likely  
that contrary to the Pollard view, it is the sheltered nature of much of the service sector rather  
than the openness of international financial services that has been damaging for overall  
productivity performance. 
4. Reversing relative economic decline 
From a low point at the end of the 1970s, relative British economic performance has  
recovered.  By 2007, on the eve of the financial crisis, real GDP per person was about 9 per  
cent ahead of that in the West German Länder and 4 per cent ahead of France compared with  
14 per cent and 12 per cent behind, respectively, in 1979.  A long period of relative economic  
decline with continental Europe had come to an end. 
         The evidence suggests that this has been the outcome of a move towards an economy  
based less on protection and regulation and more on competition than in the decades from the  
1950s through the 1970s.  In addition, labour market policies have been conducive to higher  
levels of employment.  In complete contrast to the early post-war period, the UK has become  
an economy with relatively low levels of regulation and relatively strong competition by  
OECD standards (Conway and Nicoletti, 2006; Hoj et al., 2007).  This has been a favourable  

========28========

28 
environment in which to exploit the ICT-era opportunities of new technology especially in  
market services (Nicoletti and Scarpetta, 2005). 
VII. CONCLUDING COMMENTS 
This paper provides a quantitative economic analysis of the links between openness and  
productivity performance in Britain between 1870 and 1990, paying particular attention to  
sectoral issues and focusing on three sub-periods. (1)  Before 1914, Britain‟s continued  
commitment to openness despite growing restrictions abroad had beneficial effects on  
aggregate productivity performance through the shift of resources out of low value added  
agriculture and high productivity in Britain‟s cosmopolitan commercial and financial service  
sectors. These factors are rarely given sufficient weight in the literature on British growth,  
which focuses on the difficulties faced by British industry as a result of tariffs faced in foreign  
markets and dumping by foreign producers in the British market. (2) Between the wars, given  
the drift into autarky in much of the world, the policies of protection and imperial preference  
can be seen as raising the level of domestic activity, with beneficial cyclical effects on  
industrial productivity in the short run. However, claims of a shift in the trend rate of growth  
cannot be sustained. As for the pre-World War I period, conventional analysis concentrates  
on industry and neglects the implications of the trade regime for agriculture and services. (3)  
Within the controlled wartime British economy, industry and agriculture were expanded on  
strategic grounds, and the expansion continued during the early post-war period for balance of  
payments reasons. As the world economy reintegrated on a liberal basis, however, some de- 
industrialisation was inevitable. The adjustment problems of industry were compounded by a  
need to switch from Commonwealth to European markets. However, the process of  
adjustment, which accelerated with the increased openness of the 1980s, has had benefits as  
well as costs. Dramatic improvements in Britain‟s industrial productivity performance and  

========29========

29 
rapid expansion of output as well as employment in services have brought the long period of  
British relative economic decline to an end.
