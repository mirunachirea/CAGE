Abstract 
This paper tries to calculate some facts for the “knowledge economy”.  Building on the work  of Corrado, Hulten and Sichel (CHS, 2005,9), using new data sets and a new micro survey,  we  (1)  document  UK  intangible  investment  and  (2)  see  how  it  contributes  to  economic  growth.  Regarding investment in knowledge/intangibles, we find (a) this is now greater than  tangible investment at, in 2008, £141bn and £104bn respectively; (b) that R&D is about 11%  of total intangible investment, software 15%, design 17%,  and training and organizational  capital  22%;  (d)  the  most  intangible-intensive  industry  is  manufacturing  (intangible  investment is 20% of value added) and (e) treating intangible expenditure as investment raises  market sector value added growth in the 1990s due to the ICT investment boom, but slightly  reduces  it  in the 2000s.    Regarding  the  contribution  to  growth, for 2000-08,  (a)  intangible  capital deepening accounts for 23% of labour productivity growth, against computer hardware  (12%) and TFP (40%); (b) adding intangibles to growth accounting lowers TFP growth by  about 15% (c) capitalising R&D adds 0.03% to input growth and reduces lnTFP by 0.03%  and (d) manufacturing accounts for just over 40% of intangible capital deepening plus TFP.

I. Introduction 
What drives growth in increasingly knowledge-intensive economies?  The sources of  
growth are of course an enduring subject of interest for academics and policy-makers  
alike,  and  since  at  least  Solow  (1956),  have  been studied  in  a  growth  accounting  
framework.  Whilst this gives the proximate sources, namely capital deepening, skills  
and total factor productivity, and not the ultimate sources (e.g. legal framework) it is,  
most are agreed, an important first step in marshaling data and uncovering stylized  
facts that other frameworks might explain. 
The productivity consequences of the ICT revolution have been studied in a  
growth accounting framework by many authors in many countries (see e.g. Timmer et  
al.,  2010;  Jorgenson et  al.,  2007).    But  hanging  over  this  literature  is  an  early  
suggestion (Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2000, for example), that investment in computer  
hardware needed complementary investments in knowledge assets, such as software  
and business processes, to reap productivity advantages.  This re-awakened interest in  
the application of the sources of  growth framework to information and  knowledge- 
intensive economies.  For free knowledge (e.g. from universities or the internet), the  
framework  is  quite  clear:  if  competitive  assumptions  hold,  total  factor  productivity  
growth  (TFPG)  measures  the  growth  contribution  of  knowledge  that  is  costless  to  
obtain and implement.  
However,  there  are  two  points  illustrated  nicely  by  Tufano’s  (1998)  
description of a typical financial product innovation.  He states it requires: 
“an  investment  of  $50,000  to  $5  million,  which  includes  (a)  
payments  for  legal,  accounting,  regulatory,  and  tax  advice,  (b)  time  spent  
educating  issuers,  investors,  and  traders,  (c)  investments  in  computer

systems for pricing and trading, and (d) capital and personnel commitments  
to support market-making.”  
First, in this example knowledge is not costless to obtain or commercialise and  
so cannot be relegated to TFPG.  Second, a long-established literature adds R&D to  
the growth accounting framework.  But some industries, e.g. finance and retailing, do  
no  (measured)  R&D1.    Thus  one  needs  to  consider  knowledge  investment  besides  
R&D:  this  example  suggests  trainin 
g,  marketing  and  organisational  investments  for  
example. Thus our objective in this paper is to better measure growth and its sources  
for the UK economy where:  
(i) knowledge development and implementation is not costless, and  
(ii) R& D is not the only knowledge investment.   
To do this, this paper implements the framework set out in the widely 
-cited  
papers by Corrado  
et al. (2005; henceforth, CHS), and first applied in a UK setting in  
Giorgio Marrano et al. (2009).  Whilst CHS builds upon the methods of capitalising  
tangible assets, and intangible assets such as software which are now capitalised in  
national accounts, it was the first paper to broaden the approach to a fuller range of  
intangible or knowledge assets.2    Thus it fits with  
the range of innovation investments  
mentioned above.  
More specifically, we seek to do two things in this paper.  First, we seek to  
measure  investment  in  intangible  assets  at  an  aggregate  and  industry  level.    We  
believe it of interest for it tries to docum 
ent knowledge investment in industries where  
measured R&D is apparently very low, such as finance and retailing.  Current data  
                                                       
1 
The qualification measured is importan t. In the UK at least, the Business Enterprise R&D  
survey  (BERD)  defines  R&D  to  respondents  as  ‘undertaken  to  resolve  scientific  and  technological uncertainty’.  Indeed, up until very recently, no firms in financial intermediation  for example were even sent a form.   See below for more discussion.

Earlier  contributions  were  made  by  Nakamura  (1999,  2001)  and  Machlup  (1962).    For  
European data see  Jona -Lasinio et al. (2009) and van Ark et al. (2009).

can document the physical, software and human capital deepening in these industries  
(and also R&D, when capitalised in the National Accounts in 2014).  However, this  
paper  tries  to  ask  and  answer  whether  we  are  missing  significant  investment  in  
knowledge or ideas in these sectors.3 
Second, we use these data to perform a sources 
-of -growth analysis for the UK  
using the CHS framework. 
   Whilst one might have reservations about the assumptions  
required for growth accounting (see below), we believe this is also of interest.  The  
main reason is that it enables us to investigate a number of questions that could either  
not be addressed witho 
ut these data, or all relegated to the residual.  First, as CHS  
stress,  the  capitalisation  of  knowledge  changes  the  measures  of  both  inputs  and  
outputs.  Insofar as it changes outputs, it alters the labour productivity picture for an  
economy.  Thus we can  
ask: what was the productivity performance in the late 1990s  
when  the  UK  economy  was  investing  very  heavily  (as  we  document  below)  in  
intangible assets during the early stages of the internet boom? 
Second,  we  can  then  ask:  how  was  that  performance  accounte 
d  for  by  
contributions of labour, tangible capital, intangible capital and the residual?  Here we  
can  describe  how  sources  of  growth  will  differ  when  R&D  is  capitalised  and  how  
other knowledge contribute and alter TFP.   Third, we also ask and try to answe 
r this  
question  at  industry  level.    So  we  can  ask,  for  example,  how  much  productivity  in  
non -R&D intensive sectors, such as retail and financial, was accounted for by other  
intangibles or was it mostly TFPG? 
                                                       
3 
We  also  shed  light  on  recent  considerable  interest  in  “creative”  industries, including the  software, design,  film/television,  literary,  music,  and  other artistic  industries.   Most  papers  that  study  such  activity  select  a  number  of  creative  industries,  and  then  document  their  employment or value added from published sources.  This understates the output of creative  assets, since much intangible creation is done on own-account in industries not in the usual  creative  list  e.g.  software  spending  in  financial  services  or  design  in  retail.   Nor  does  this  approach show how much creative industries contribute to economic growth, as we are able to  do (conditional on the assumptions we make).   

========5========

4 
In  adapting  and  extending  the  framework  that  CHS  used  for  the  US,  we  
proceed as follows.  First, we gather data on the intangible assets that CHS suggest,  
but by industry. Fukao et al. (2009) and van Rooijen-Horsten et al., (2008) do this for  
Japan and Holland, but they do not do growth accounting to derive the contributions  
of the industries to the total. Second, we update some of the methods of CHS.  For  
example,  much  intangible  spend,  like  R&D,  is  own-account.    CHS  had  no  own- 
account  estimates  for  design or  for  financial  services.    We  apply  the  National  
Accounts software method to estimate such own-account spending, using interviews  
with design and financial companies to identify occupations and time use and thereby  
derive intangible spend from wage data.4    In addition, there is almost no information  
on the depreciation of intangible assets. 
5 
   Thus we conducted a survey of over 800  
companies  on  the  life  lengths  of  their  intangible  spend,  by  asset,  to  gather  data  on  
depreciation.  
Third, we provide (gross o 
utput based) growth accounting results by industry  
aggregated consistently into value 
-added based growth accounting for the UK market  
sector,  using  the  approach  of  Jorgenson  
et  al. (2007).    Thus  we  can  examine  the  
contributions  of  different  industries  to  overall  growth.    This  then  speaks  to  the  
question  of,  for  example,  how  much  manufacturing  versus  financial  services  
contributed to overall TFP growth.   
On specifically UK data, our work is closely related to the industry-level work  
by Basu et al. (2004).  They incorporated software as a productive asset and looked at  
productivity and TFPG in 28 industries from 1990 to 2000.  They did not have data

Official  own -account  software  investment  is  estimated  by  (1)  finding  software  writing  occupations, (2 ) applying a multiple to their wage bills to account for overhead costs and (3)  applying a fraction of time such occupations spend on writing long 
to short term bug fixes, maintenance etc.  We duplicate this approach for finance a

however on other intangible assets and so whilst they were able to document software  
and  hardware  spending  across  industries,  they  were  not  able  to  look  at  other  co- 
investments  in  innovation.    However,  Oliner  et  al. (2008) considered  a  proxy  for  
intangible investments applying the Basu et al. (2004) framework to US data.  As will  
be clear, our work builds on these studies and we rely heavily on their important work  
on  measuring  software  and  also  tangible  assets,  now  embodied  in  official  UK  data  
collection.  Likewise, our work is also closely related to EUKLEMS (O’Mahony and  
Timmer, 2009).  Their dataset includes software, and we extend their framework with  
additional intangibles, explicitly setting out the industry/market sector aggregation.  
Whilst  growth  accounting  is  an  internally  consistent  method  for  analysing  
productivity  growth  there  are  of  course  limits  to the  analysis  that  caveat  our  work.   
First, in the absence of independent measures of the return to capital we are compelled  
to  assume  constant  returns  to  scale  and  perfect  competition  to  measure  the  output  
elasticities of capital residually from the cost share of labour.  A consistent framework  
for growth and innovation accounting with these assumptions relaxed is outside the  
scope  of  this  current  paper.    But  we  hope  that  readers  sceptical  of  the  growth  
accounting  assumptions  would  still  find  of  interest  the  findings  on  knowledge  
investment and how their addition to the growth accounting framework changes the  
usual findings (which turns out to be quite considerably).  We also hope that readers  
likewise sceptical of capitalising the full range of intangibles will find our work on  
R&D, which is to be officially capitalised in 2014, of interest.  
Second, like other work in this area, we are of course limited in what we can  
do by data uncertainty.  Measures of intangible assets are clearly difficult to obtain,  
especially for the own-account part of organisational capital.  Deflators for intangibles  

========7========

6 
are  as  yet  uncertain.    Our  industry  data  covers  seven  broad  industries  in  the  UK  
market sector since finer detail on intangible spend is very hard to obtain.   
We have two sets of findings (a) on knowledge spending and (b) implications  
for growth.  On knowledge spending, first, investment in long-lived knowledge, which  
creates  intangible  assets,  now  exceeds  tangible  investment  by  £37bn.    In  2008,  
intangible  and  tangible investment  was  at  around  £141bn  and  £104bn respectively.   
R&D  is  about  10%  of  such  spend.    Training,  design  and  software  are  the  largest  
categories of intangible  investment, and are particularly important in services.  The  
effect on market sector gross value added (MGVA) of treating intangible expenditure  
as  investment  is  to  raise  MGVA  growth  in  the  1990s,  but  slightly  reduce  it  in  the  
2000s.  The latter finding is similar to that found in the US (Oliner et al., 2008 and  
Corrado and Hulten, 2010).  Second, around 60% of this spending is own account.   
Thus measures of the “creative economy” (ONS, 2006) that assemble data for a list of  
“creative industries” are missing significant creative activity outside those industries. 
On the implications for growth, for 2000-08, the most recent period with data  
available,  intangible  capital  deepening  accounts  for  23%  of  labour  productivity  
growth,  a  larger  contribution  than  computer  hardware  (12%),  other  tangible  
investments  (18%,  buildings,  vehicles,  plant)  or  human  capital  (7%).    The  largest  
contribution  is  TFP,  at  40%.    These  findings  are  quite  robust  to  variations  in  
depreciation and assumptions on intangible measures.  Capitalised R&D accounts for  
about 2% of LPG and lowers the contribution of TFP by 2 percentage points. 
Regarding  industries,  the  main  finding  here  is  the  importance  of  
manufacturing, which contributes just over 40% of the total contribution to MGVA  
growth of intangible investment and TFPG (but with a 20% employment share).  We  

========8========

7 
also  find  important  roles for  retail/hotels/transport,  (27%  of  the  total  contribution),  
business services (22%) and finance (12%). 
The rest of this paper proceeds as follows.  Section II sets out a formal model,  
and  section III  our  data  collection.  Sections  IV to  VI  our  results  and  section  VII 
concludes.   
II. A formal model and definitions 
In this paper we undertake growth accounting for the UK market sector.  But we are  
also  interested  in  how  industries  contribute  to  the  overall  market  changes  and  to  
analyse  that  we  follow  Jorgenson et  al. (2007).6    The  key  point  is  that  at  industry  
level,  a value added production function exists under restrictive assumptions and it is  
therefore  preferable  to  work  with  TFP  computed  from  gross  output.    But  at  the  
aggregate  level,  productivity  is  best  defined  using  value  added  (to  avoid  double  
counting).  So w 
hat is the relation between the industry components of growth and the  
whole market sector? 
We start with two definitions of TFPG. Supposing there is one capital, labour  
and intermediate asset (respectively K, L and X) which produce output Y 
j 
in industry  
j.    That capital asset might or might not be intangible capital.  Thus for each industry,  
we have the following gross output defined ∆lnTFPj 
        ln ln ln ln lnTFP Y v K v L v Xj j K j j L j j X j j, , , 
(1)

Where  the  terms  in  “v”  are  shares  of  factor  costs  in  industry  nominal  gross  
output,  averaged  over  two  periods.    For  the  economy  as  a  whole,  the  definition  of  
economy wide ∆lnTFP based on value added is  
      ln ln ln lnTFP V v K v LKL 
(2) 
Where the “v” terms here, that are not subscripted by “j”, are shares of K and  
L  payments  in  economy  wide  nominal  value  added.    Now  we  write  down  two  
definitions.  First, define the relation between industry gross output and industry value  
added as  
    ln ln lnY v V v Xj V j j X j j,, 
(3) 
which  says  that  (changes  in  real)  industry  gross  are  weighted  averages  of  
changes in real value added and intermediates.  Second, write changes in aggregate  
real  value  added  as  a  weighted  sum  of  changes  in  industry  real  value  added  as  
follows. 
     ln ln , ( ), 0.5( )V w V w P V P V w w wj j j V j j V j j j j t j t, , , , 1 
jj 
(4) 
We may then write down value added  growth in the industry as a weighted  
average of K, L and (gross output-based) ΔlnTFPj    
      ln ln ln lnV K L TFPvvK j L j,,1j j j jv v v (5) 
V j V j V j, , , 

========10========

9 
where the weights on K and L are a combination of the shares of K and L in  
industry gross output and the shares of industry gross output in aggregate value added.  
We  are  now  in  position  to  write  down  our  desired  relationship,  that  is  the  
relation  between  economy-wide  real  value  added  growth  and  its  industry  
contributions 
      ln ln ln lnV w K w L TFP   v v w   K j L j j,,     j j j j j 
   v v v 
j j jV j V j V j, , , 
(6) 
Which says that the contributions of Kj and Lj to whole-economy value added  
growth depend upon the share of Vj in total V (wj) the share of K and L in gross and  
value added.   The contribution of ΔlnTFPj depends on the share of Vj in total V (wj)  
and  the  share  of  industry  value  added  in  gross  output.    The  weight  on  TFP  is  
approximately  ( / )P Y P VY j j V 
, 
which  is  the  usual  interpretation  of  the  Domar  (1961)  
weight. It sums to more than one, since an improvement in industry TFP contributes 
directly to the average of all TFPs and indirectly if it produces output that is then an  
intermediate in other industries.7 
Finally, in reality we do not have one capital and labour unit, but many.  These  
are then aggregated across different types. For l 
abour, see below, we use, education,  
age (experience), and gender; for capital, different types of both tangible assets and  
intangible assets.  Denoting the capital and labour types  
k and l we have following  
                                                       
7 
As Jorgenson  et al. (2007) point out, comparing (6) with (2) gives the relation between this  industry aggregated input/output relation and that implied by the TFP expression in (2), which  involves some additional terms in reallocation of K and L between industries.  These terms  turn out to be very small in our data.

(7) 
In our results we document the following.  First, we set out the gross output  
growth accounting results for each industry, (1).  Second, we take these data and set  
out the contributions for each industry to the growth of aggregate value added, (4).   
Third,  we  sum  up  the  contributions  across  industries  to  the  decomposition  of  
aggregate  (market  sector)  value-added, (6).    In  each  case  we  carry  out  the  
decomposition with and without intangibles. 
Before  proceeding  to  the  data,  some  further  theory  remarks  on  the  
measurement of capital.  As pointed out by e.g. Jorgenson and Griliches (1967) the  
conceptually  correct  measure  of  capital  in  this  productivity  context  is  the  flow  of  
capital services.  This raises a number of measurement problems set out, for example,  
in the OECD productivity manual (2001).  We estimate the now standard measure as  
follows.    First,  we  build  a  real  capital  stock  via  the  perpetual  inventory  method  
whereby for any capital asset k, the stock of that assets evolves according to 
K I Kk t k t k t k t, , , , 1  (1 )

11 
Where  I  is  investment  over  the  relevant  period  and  the  geometric  rate  of  
depreciation.    Real  tangible  investment  comes  from  nominal  tangible  investment  
deflated by an investment price index.  Second, that investment price is converted into  
a rental price using the Hall-Jorgenson relation, where we assume an economy-wide  
rate of return such that the capital rental price times the capital stock equals the total  
economy-wide operating surplus.8 
III. Data 
Time period and data sources 
For the industry analysis, ONS does not publish real intermediate input data and so we  
used  the  EUKLEMS  November  2009  release,  which  gives  data  up  to  2007.    For  
intangibles, our industry level data is available 1992-2007 since this is when Input- 
Output (IO) tables are consistently available from.  Data for the whole market sector  
is available going back to 1980 up to 2008 (the most recent year National Accounts  
are  available).    Thus  we  work  with  two  data  sets:  (1)  market  sector,  1980-2008,  
consistent with National Accounts 2008, and (2) industry level 1992-2007 (the data  
turn out to be very close over the overlapping years).    Appendix Table A.1 documents  
our  data  sources  in  detail  with  a  comparison  between  our  sources  and  the  ONS.   
Appendix Table A.2 compares the growth-accounting results when using KLEMS and  
ONS data respectively.

Industries

The  EUKLEMS  data  includes  measures  of  output,  and  various  categories  of  
employment and capital at the industry level for 71 industries, classified according to  
the European NACE revision 1 classification.  We then aggregate these data to the  
seven industries described in TABLE 1.  The choice of the seven industries is dictated  
by the availability of the intangible data: training and management consulting data are  
only available at these aggregated levels.

Business activities, excluding real  estate and renting of dwellings 
We measure output for the market sector, defined here as industries A to K,  
excluding actual and imputed housing rents.  Note this differs from the ONS official  
market  sector  definition,  which  includes  part  of  sections  O  and  P,  as  well  as  the  
private delivery of education, health and social care.  Since sections O and P include a

13 
heterogeneous mix of personal and recreational services9, including hard 
-to -measure  
areas  like  museums  
and 
refuse  collection,  we  omitted  them.    We  also  used  
disaggregated real valu 
e added data for this industry definition.   
For the  years where industry level data is available, the data are bottom 
-up,  
that  is,  derived  at  the  industry  level  and  aggregated  subsequently.    Aggregation  of  
nominal  variables  is  by  simple  addition.    Aggrega 
tes  of  real  variables  are  a  share 
- 
weighted superlative index for changes, benchmarked in levels to 2005 nominal data.   
For other years, the intangible data are for the market sector and the other output and  
input data from ONS, latest National Accounts, ag 
gregated from industry values.  
Outputs and tangible inputs 
EUKLEMS  also  provides  growth  accounting  data,  but  since  we  have  expanded  the  
amount of capital and changed value added we  do our own growth accounting.   In  
addition, the EUKLEMS labour composition data is slightly different to the ONS data  
(ONS have access to more data).  From the output and intermediate accounts of the  
EU  KLEMS  dataset  we  have  used  the  series  of  industry  Gross  Output  and  Gross  
Value Added at current basic prices, intermediate inputs at current purchasers’ prices  
and  their  corresponding  price  and  volume  indices.    Intermediate  inputs  comprise  
energy, materials and services. 
The tangible capital variables from EUKLEMS that we used are nominal and  
real  gross  fixed  capital  formation,  the  corresponding  price  index,  real  fixed  capital  
stock  and  capital  compensation,  all  disaggregated  by  type  of  assets.  Capital  
compensation  equals  the  sum  of  the  gross  operating  surplus,  which  includes  the

The official definitions are as follows: ‘O: Other Community, Social and Personal Service  Activities’ including sewage and refuse disposal, activities of membership organisations, film,  television and radio, artistic and literary creation and interpretation, entertainment activities,  news  agencies,  libraries  and  museums,  sporting  activities,  gambling,  washing  and  dry  cleaning, hairdressing and other personal services’.  ‘P: Private Households Employing staff.’ 

========15========

14 
remainder  of  mixed  income,  plus  taxes  on  production, after  subtracting  labour  
compensation  of  the  self-employed.  In  practice,  it  is  derived  as  value  added  minus  
labour compensation.  We shall of course amend capital compensation to incorporate  
compensation for intangible capital assets. 
The EUKLEMS capital data distinguishes nine asset types, of which we use  
transport equipment, computing and communications equipment and other machinery  
and  equipment,  and  total  non-residential  investment.    We  use  ONS  estimates  for  
software.    We  excluded  residential  structures  (they  are  not  capital  for  firm  
productivity analysis).  
Depreciation rates for ICT tangible capital are as in the EUKLEMS, which in  
turn follows Jorgenson et al. (2005).  Depreciation is assumed to be geometric at rates  
for vehicles, buildings, plant and computer equipment of 0.25, 0.025, 0.13, and 0.40  
respectively.    As  for  intangible  assets,  they  are  assumed  to  be  the  same  for  all  
industries.  We discuss depreciation in the context of intangible assets in more detail  
below, but the asset-specific depreciation rates for intangibles are as follows:  33% for  
software,  60%  for  advertising  and  market  research,  40%  for  training  and  
organisational  investments,  20%  for  R&D  (broadly  defined,  thus  including  Design,  
Mineral  Exploration,  Financial  Innovation,  Artistic  Originals  and  non-scientific  
R&D).  Given that the EU KLEMS database does not provide data on capital tax rates  
by country, industry and year, and that Timmer et al. (2010) point out that evidence  
for major European countries shows that their inclusion has only a very minor effect  
on growth rates of capital services and TFP, we did not introduce a tax adjustment. 
The capitalisation of intangibles requires various adjustments to the output and  
input  data.    The  exact  treatment  depends  on  whether  the  asset  capitalised  was  
purchased or created in-house.  Own-account investments are treated as an additional  

========16========

15 
part  of  gross  output.    So  a  bank  that  sells  financial  services  using  own-account  
software is also treated as a software producer.  Data on intermediate consumption are  
unaffected.    In  the  case  of  purchased  assets,  these  are  currently  recorded  within  
intermediate  consumption.    The  capitalisation  process  removes  these  intermediate  
purchases and allocates them to investment or Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)  
in the National Accounts nomenclature.  Thus intermediate consumption is reduced,  
GFCF  is  increased,  gross  output  is  unaffected  and  value-added  is  increased.    The  
above changes of course refer to levels. Impacts on growth rates will depend on the  
relative growth rates of intangible outputs and other final output and their weights in  
value-added.  
Labour services 
The  labour  services  data  are  for  1992-2007  and  are  our  own  estimates  based  on  
EUKLEMS person-hours by industry.  We use these along with Labour Force Survey 
microdata to estimate composition-adjusted person hours, where the adjustment uses  
wage bill shares for composition groups for age, education and gender.  Person hours  
are  annual  person-hours,  with  persons  including  the  employed,  self-employed and  
those with two jobs.  For the longer period based on market sector aggregates, we use  
an  equivalent  method,  using  LFS  microdata  to  generate  wages  and  average  hours  
worked at the individual level and then gross up using population weights.  
Labour and capital shares 
The Compensation of Employees (COE) data are consistent with the labour services  
data. Mixed income is allocated to labour according to the ratio of labour payments to  
MGVA excluding mixed income.  With intangibles capitalised, MGVA changes, and  
the  allocation  is  done  on  the  basis  of  this  changed  ratio.    Gross  operating  surplus  

========17========

16 
(GOS)  is  always  computed  as  MGVA  less  COE  so  that  GOS  +COE  =MGVA  by  
construction.  
Details of measurement of intangible assets 
CHS (2006) distinguish three classes of intangible assets:  
i) 
computerised information: software and databases 
ii) 
innovative  property:  (scientific  &  non-scientific)  R&D,  design  
(including architectural and engineering design), product development  
in  the  financial  industry,  exploration  of  minerals  and production  of  
artistic originals. 
iii) 
economic  competencies:  firm  investment  in  reputation,  human  and  
organisational capital. 
Our  intangible  data  update  industry-level  data  reported  in  Gill  and  Haskel  
(2008).  Own account investment is allocated to the industry wherein the investment  
is  carried  out.    Purchased  is  allocated  to  industries  via  the  input  output  tables.   
Particular  industry  categories  (e.g.  product  development  in  finance,  exploration  of  
minerals, copyright) are allocated to that industry.10    
Computerised information 
Computerised  information  comprises  computer  software,  both  purchased  and  own- 
account, and computerized databases.  Software is already capitalised and thus we use  
these data, by industry, as described by Chesson and Chamberlin (2006).  Purchased  
software data are based on company investment surveys and own-account based on  
                                                       
10 
Copyright, or more accurately, investment in artistic originals, is problematic for the correct  
allocation  likely  is  somewhere  between  publishers  (manufacturing)  and  artists,  since  each  
ha ve some ownership share of the final original. The latter are mostly in the omitted sector  
“O”, which covers a miscellany of businesses from performing arts to museums to recycling.   Overall however, the numbers are very small and any error likely trivial. 

========18========

the  wage  bill  of  employees  in  computer  software  occupations,  adjusted  downwards  
for the fraction of time spent on creating new software (as opposed to, say, routine  
maintenance) and then upwards for associated overhead costs (a method we use for  
design below).  Software is already included in the EUKLEMS, but for consistency,  
we subtract it out of all variables and build our own stock and implied service flow  
using the ONS data.  
Innovative property 
For  business Scientific  R&D we  use  expenditure  data  by  industry  derived  from  the  
Business  Enterprise  R&D  survey  (BERD).  To  avoid  double  counting  of  R&D  and  
software investment, we subtract R&D spending in “computer and related activities”  
(SIC 72) from R&D spending since this is already included in the software investment  
data.11    We note that BERD is collected according to Frascati Manual definitions and 
to be incorporated into  National Accounts requires some  adjustments  
(for example,  
Frascati data 
on tangible  
capital investment by R&D  
producers needs to be converted  
into  capital  rental  payments.  In  practice  these  types  of  adjustments  turn  out  to  be  
rather small (Corrado, Goodridge and Haskel, 2011).   
Like  computerised  in 
formation,  
mineral  exploration,  and  production  of  
artistic  originals (copyright  for  short)  are  already  capitalised  in  National  Accounts  
and the data here are simply data for Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) from the  
ONS.  The production of artistic originals covers, “original films, sound recordings,  
manuscripts,  tapes  etc.,  on  which  musical  and  drama  performances,  TV  and  radio  
programmes, and literary and artistic output are recorded.” Based on work currently in  
                                                       
11 
The BERD data gives data on own -account spending.  Spending is allocated to the industry  within which the product upon which firms are spending belongs.  That is we assume that  
R&D on say, pharmaceutical products takes place in the pharmaceutical indus 
R&D spending is allocated to business services.  Thus the BERD data differs from that in the  
supply use tables, which estimates between -unit transactions of R&D.  
try.  General

progress for the IPO (Goodridge and Haskel, 2011) we suspect that these investment  
numbers  are  understated  and  so  should  be  regarded  as  a  lower  bound  on  the  true  
numbers.    Expenses  on  mineral  exploration are  valued  at  cost  (ONS  National  
Accounts, 2008) and explicitly not included in R&D.  
The  measurement  methodology  for  New  product  development  costs  in  the  
financial industry follows that of own account software above (and therefore replaces  
the  CHS  assumption  of  20%  of  intermediate  consumption  by  the  financial  services  
industry).  This new method reduces this category substantially.  Further details are in  
Haskel and Pesole (2011) but a brief outline is as follows.  First, we interviewed a  
number  of  financial  firms  to  try  to  identify  the  job  titles  of  workers  who  were  
responsible  for  product  development.    Second,  we  compared  these  titles  with  the  
available occupational and wage data from the Annual Survey on Hours and Earnings  
(ASHE).    The  occupational  classification  most  aligned  with  the  job  titles  was  
‘economists, statisticians and researchers’.  Third, we asked our interviewees (1) how  
much time was spent by these occupations on developing new products  that would  
last more than a year (some firms based their estimates on staff time sheets), and (2)  
about associated  overhead  costs.    Armed  with  these  estimates,  we  went  to  the  
occupational  data  in  the  ASHE  and  derived  a  time  series  of  earnings  for  those  
particular  occupations  in  financial  intermediation.    Own-account  investment  in  
product  development  is  therefore  the  wage  bill,  times  a  mark-up  for  other  costs  
(capital,  overheads  etc.),  times  the  fraction  of  time  those  occupations  spend  on  
building long-term projects.  All this comes to around 0.52% of gross output in 2005  
(note that reported R&D in BERD is 0.01% of gross output). 
For  new  architectural and  engineering  design we  again  updated  the  CHS  
method (that used output of the design industry).  To measure better such spending,  

========20========

19 
we used the software method for own-account, and purchased data, by industry, are  
taken  from  the  supply-use  tables  (see  details  in  Galindo-Rueda et  al.,  2010).    The  
choice of occupations and the time allocation are, as in financial services, taken from  
interviews with a number of design firms.  Interestingly, almost all of the design firms  
we interviewed have time sheets for their employees which break out their time into  
administration,  design  and  client  interaction/pitching  for  new  business  (almost  all  
firms target, for example, that junior designers spend little time on administration and  
senior  more  time  on  pitching).    Finally, R&D  in  social  sciences  and  humanities is  
estimated as twice the sales of SIC73.2 “Social sciences and humanities”, where the  
doubling is assumed to capture own-account spending.  This is a small number. 
Economic competencies 
Advertising  expenditure is  estimated  from  the  IO  Tables  by  summing  intermediate  
consumption  on  Advertising  (product  group  113)  for  each  industry.    Firm-specific  
human capital, that is training provided by firms, was estimated as follows.  Whilst  
there  are  a  number  of  surveys  (such  as  the  Labour  Force  Survey)  who  ask  binary  
questions (such as whether the worker received training around the Census date), to  
the  best  of  our  knowledge  there  is  only  one  survey  on  company  training  spending,  
namely  the  National  Employer  Skills  Survey  (NESS)  which  we  have  available  for  
2004,  2006,  2007.12    We  also  have  summary  data  for  1988  (from  an  unpublished  
paper kindly supplied by John Barber).  The key feature of the survey, like the US  
Survey of Employer 
-provided Training (SEPT) used in CHS, is that 
it asks for direct  
employer spending on training (e.g. in house training centres, services purchased from  
                                                       
12 
For  example  NESS07  samples  79,000  establishments  in  England  and  spending  data 
collected in a follow -up survey among 7,190 establishments who reported during the main  
NESS07 survey that they had funded or arranged training in the previous 12 months. Results  
were grossed -up to the UK population.   To obtain a time series, we  backca st the  industry level  series using EU KLEMS wage bill  data  benchmarking the data to  four  cross sections.

outside providers, etc.) and indirect costs via the opportunity cost of the employee’s  
time whilst spend training and therefore not in current production.13    This opportunity  
costs turns out to be about equal to the former.  
One question is whether all such surveyed training creates a lasting asset or is  
some  of  it  short 
-lived.    We  lack  detailed  knowledge  on  this,  but  have  subtracted  
spending  on  Health  
and  Safety  training,  around  10%  of  total  spend.    Whilst  this  
subtraction lowers the level of training spending, it turns out to affect the contribution  
of training to growth at only the 4 
th 
decimal place.  A second question is the extent to  
which such training financed by the firm might be incident on the worker, in the sense  
of  reducing  worker  pay  relative  to  what  it  might  have  been  without  training,  
unobserved by the data gatherer.  O’Mahony and Peng (2010) use the fraction of time  
that training is reported to be outside working hours, arguing that such a fraction is  
borne by the worker.  Our data is all for training in working hours.  
It might be argued that including both firm-specific human capital and labour  
composition is double counting.  For example, labour composition includes age: if the  
increased wages of more experienced workers is partly due to the additional training  
they  have  received,  there  may  be  some  double-counting  of  the  contribution  of  that  
training.  Recall however that firm-specific human capital data are training costs paid  
for by the firm.  Following Becker (1962), firms will pay only for training specific to  
the firm: training that will yield no market wage increase.  If this holds there is no  
double counting: general skills are captured in market-wide wages and so in labour  
composition, and firm-specific skills in firm-provided training costs.  
                                                       
13 
Firms are asked how many paid hours workers spend away from production whilst training  and the hourly wage of such workers. 

========22========

21 
Finally, our data on investment in organisational structure relies on purchased  
management consulting, on which we have consulted the Management Consultancy  
Association (MCA), and own-account time-spend, the value of the latter being 20% of  
managerial wages, where managers are defined via occupational definitions.  We test  
the robustness of the 20% figure below. 
Prices and depreciation 
Rates of depreciation and the prices of intangible assets are less well established.  The  
R&D  literature  appears  to  have  settled  on  a  depreciation  rate  of  around  20%,  and  
OECD recommends 33% for software.  Solovechik (2010) has a range of 5% to 30%  
for artistic originals, depending on the particular asset in question.  To shed light on  
this and the depreciation of other assets, in our intangible assets survey we asked for  
life lengths for various intangibles (Awano et al., 2009).  The responses were close to 
the  assumed  depreciation  rates  in  CHS.,  depending  on  the  assumptions  one  makes  
about declining balance depreciation.  Once again, we shall explore the robustness of  
our  results  to  depreciation,  but  note  in  passing  that  our  assets  are  assumed  to  
depreciate very  fast  and  so  are  not  very  sensitive  to  depreciation  rates,  unless  one  
assumes much slower rates, in which case intangibles are even more important than  
suggested here. 
The asset price deflators for software are the official deflators (own-account  
and purchased), but otherwise the GDP deflator is used for intangible assets.  This is  
an area where almost nothing is known, aside from some very exploratory work by  
the BEA and Corrado et al. (2011).  These papers attempt to derive price deflators for  
knowledge  from  the  price  behaviour  of  knowledge  intensive  industries  and  the  
productivity of knowledge producing industries.  Two observations suggest that using  
the GDP deflator overstates the price deflator for knowledge, and so understates the  

========23========

22 
impact of knowledge on the economy.  First, many knowledge-intensive prices have  
been falling relative to GDP.  Second, the advent of the internet and computers would  
seem  to  be  a  potential  large  rise  in  the  capability  of  innovators  to  innovate,  which  
would again suggest a lowering of the price of  knowledge due to strong  growth in  
productivity in the process of innovation itself, in contrast to the rise in prices implied  
by the GDP deflator.  Thus our use of the GDP deflator almost certainly understates  
the importance of intangible assets.  
Relation of intangible approach to other approaches  
Haskel  et  al. (2009,  2011)  discusses  how  this  work  relates  to  the  definition  of  
innovation and the Frascati and Oslo manuals.  It is clearly consistent with the work  
on  IT  and  economic  growth  (see,  for  example,  Jorgenson  et  al.,  2007),  the  
capitalisation  of  software  and  the  forthcoming  capitalisation  of  R&D  in  national  
accounts, both of which are part of the process of recognizing spending on intangibles  
as building a (knowledge) capital stock.  van Ark and Hulten (2007) point out that  
with an expanded view of capital, following the CHS argument, innovation “…would  
appear  in  several  forms  in  the  sources  of  growth  framework:  through  the  explicit  
breakout of IT capital formation, through the addition of intangible capital to both the  
input  and  output  sides  of  the  source  of  growth  equation,  through  the  inclusion  of  
human capital formation in the form of changes in labor ‘quality’, and through the  
‘multifactor  productivity’  (MFP)  residual.  For  shorthand,  we  refer  to  ‘innovation’  
contribution as the sum of the intangible contribution and TFP (and sometimes labour  
composition), but take no stand on this: we provide other components for the reader.  

========24========

23 
Accuracy of intangible measures  
The following points are worth making.  First, data on minerals, copyright, software  
and  R&D  are  taken  from  official  sources.    As  mentioned  above,  preliminary  work  
suggests an undercounting of copyright spending. Second, data on workplace training  
are  taken  from  successive  waves  of  an  official  government  survey,  weighted  using  
ONS sampling weights.   Once  again one might  worry that such data  are subject to  
biases and the like but this does look like the best source currently available.  
Third,  data  on  design,  finance  and  investment  in  organisational  capital  are  
calculated using the software method for own-account spending, but the IO tables for  
purchases.  The use of the IO tables at least ensures the purchased data are consistent  
with official National Accounts.  The use of the own account software method means  
that  we  have  to  identify  the  occupations  who  undertake knowledge  investment,  the  
time fraction they spend on it and additional overhead costs in doing so.  For design  
and  financial  services  we  have  followed  the  software  method  by  undertaking  
interviews with firms to try to obtain data on these measures.  Such interviews are of  
course just a start but our estimates are based then on these data points.  For own- 
account  organisational  change  we  use  an  assumed  fraction  of  time  spent  (20%)  by  
managers  on  organisational  development.   This  remains  a  subject  for  future work:  
below we test for robustness to this assumption.  
To  examine  all  further,  we  undertook  two  further  studies.    First,  we  used  
survey  data  kindly  supplied  by  Stephen  Roper  and  described  in  detail  in  Barnett  
(2009).    These  data  ask  around  1,500  firms  about  their  spending  on  software,  
branding,  R&D,  design  and  organisational  capital.    The  firms  are  sampled  from  
service  and  hi-tech  manufacturing  industries.    Comparison  of  the  proportions  of  

========25========

24 
spending  on  the  intangible  assets  with  those  proportions  in  our  manufacturing  and  
business services gives similar answers.  
Second,  we  undertook  a  new  survey  of  firms,  the  results  of  which  are  fully  
documented  in  Awano et  al. (2010).    In  terms  of  the  spending  numbers  here,  that  
micro study found spending on R&D, software, marketing and training to be in line  
with  the  macro-based  numbers  in  this  report.    However,  the  implied  spending  on  
design  and  organisational  capital  were  very  much  lower  in  the  survey.    This  again  
suggests that these investment data require further work.  
IV. Results 
Intangible spending: market sector over time 
FIGURE 1  presents  market  sector  nominal  total  tangible  and  intangible  investment  
data.    In  the  late  1990s  intangible  investment  has  exceeded  tangible.    Note  that,  
intangible  investment  falls  less and  recovers  more  quickly  during  recessions.   
However, depreciation rates for intangible assets are significantly faster than those for  
tangibles.    Thus  a  relatively  small  slowdown  in  intangible  investment  turns  out  to  
generate the same fall in capital stock as a steep fall in tangible spend, so the changes  
in resulting capital services are similar. 
TABLE  2  shows  investment  by  intangible  asset  for  1990,  1995,  2000  and  
2008  with  tangible  investment  for  comparison. The  intangible  category  with  the  
highest  investment  figures  is  training,  growing  to  approximately  a  third  of  tangible  
investment  by  2008.    For  information  we  also  report  GDP  and  MGVA  excluding  
intangibles.

Industry intangible investment 
TABLE 3 reports tangible and intangible investment by industry, 1997-2005.  Finance  
and  manufacturing  invest  very  strongly  in  intangibles  relative  to  tangibles:  in  both  
sectors, intangible investment is three times that in tangibles.  It is interesting to note  
in passing that this raises important questions on how to classify manufacturing since  
it is undertaking a very good deal of intangible activity (manufacturing own-account  
intangible investment is 15% of value added by 2007 for example).  
If  we  express  the  data  in TABLE 3 as  a  proportion  of  industry  value-added  
(adjusted  for  intangibles)  we  find  that  financial  services  is  the  most  intangible  
intensive,  at  (averaged  1997-2007)  20%  of  industry  value-added,  followed  by  
manufacturing  at  19%  and  business  services  at  17%.    Construction,  utilities  and  
distribution  are  all  between  9  and  12%  with  agriculture  and  mining  at  5%.    In  
financial services intangible investment made up an even higher share of value-added  
in the late 1990s, due to the software boom, especially in the run up to Y2K.   
Which  particular  intangible  assets  are  most  important  in  which  industries?   
TABLE 4 shows the asset share of total intangible spending by industry (in 2007 the  
shares are very stable over time).  Starting with manufacturing, the largest share of all  
intangible  spending  is  innovative  property  (56%),  with  software  being  an  8%.   
Compare with financial intermediation, where innovative property accounts for only  
19% whereas ’economic competencies’ (training, branding and organization building)  
accounts for over 50%, whilst software is 27%.  Similarly, in retailing, software and  
economic competencies are much more important than innovative property.

Notes:    Innovative  property  is  R&D,  mineral  exploration  and  copyright  creation,  design,  financial  product development and social science research.  Economic competencies are advertising & market  research, training and organisational investment.   All data are shares of total investment: upper panel  sums to 100% since categories are exhaustive, lower panel shows a sample of individual assets that are  part of the asset groups in the upper panel. 
To shed light on the importance of non-R&D spend outside manufacturing, the  
lower  panel  sets  out  some  detail  on  selected  individual  measures.    As  the  top  line  
shows, R&D accounts, in manufacturing, for 31% of all intangible spend, but 0% in  
finance,  and  5%  in  trade.    Training,  in  line  2,  accounts for  10%  in  manufacturing,  
31% in trade and 8% in finance.  Investment in organisational capital, line 3, is 19%  
in manufacturing, 22% in trade and a considerable 31% in finance.  Finally, branding  
is twice as important in trade and finance as in manufacturing.  Thus we can conclude  
that  the  ‘non-R&D’  intangible  spending,  outside  manufacturing,  is  mostly  due  to  
software, training, organisational capital and branding.

V. Growth accounting results: market sector  
Growth accounting results for the market economy  
Our growth accounting results are set out in TABLE 5.  Consider first the top panel of  
data, which reports the contributions to growth in a standard framework that doesn’t 
include intangibles.  Labour productivity growth (LPG; column 1) rose in the 1990s  
and then fell back somewhat in the 2000s.  The rise in the late 1990s is due to the  
introduction  of  a  new  methodology  for  Financial  Services  Indirectly  Measured  
(FISIM),  and  other  methodological  changes  in  the  2008  National  Accounts  (see  
Giorgio Marrano et  al.,  2009).14    The  contribution  of  labour  quality,  column  2,  is  
fairly steady throughout.  Tangible capital input, in columns 3 and 4, grew quickly in  
the 1990s, but fell in the 2000s, especially computer hardware.  Thus the overall TFP  
record was a ri 
se in the second half of the 1990s and then a fall (column 6).   
Consider now the second set of results in panel 1.  The inclusion of intangibles  
raises output growth in the 1990s, with little effect in the 2000s, due to a decline in  
intangible  investment  
growth  in  the  2000s  following  the  boom  in  intangible  
investment in the preceding years.  The impact of labour quality, column 2, falls due  
to the fall in the labour share.   The contribution of tangible capital, columns 3 and 4,  
falls  somewhat  relative  to  
the  upper  panel  as  the  inclusion  of  intangibles  alters  the  
factor shares of these inputs.  In column 5 we see the contribution of the intangible  
inputs; stronger in the 1990s and weaker  
– though still important – in the 2000s.  Thus  
                                                       
14 
Note that a market sect or TFP growth rate of over 1.5% is comparatively high by historical  data (that is, based on studies  before the introduction of a new methodology for  UK ).  The reason for this is that FISIM has added around 0.5 pppa to ALPG, all of which  adds  t o  TFPG  almost  directly  since  no  new  inputs  are  involved.    Thus  even  without  intangibles, the productivity picture changes.

Notes:    Data are average growth rates per hour per year for intervals shown, calculated as changes in  natural  logs.    Contributions  are  Tornquist  indices.  First  column  is  value-added growth  in  per  hour  terms.  Column 2 is the contribution of labour services per hour, namely growth in labour services per  hour times share of labour in MGVA.  Column 3 is growth in computer capital services times share in  MGVA.  Column 4 is growth in other tangible capital services (buildings, plant, vehicles) times share  in MGVA.  Column 5 is growth in intangible capital services times share in MGVA.  Column 6 is TFP,  namely  column  1  minus  the  sum  of  columns  2  to  5.    Column  7  is  the  share  of  labour  payments  in  MGVA.  Columns 8-10 are the shares of particular contributions in labour productivity growth. 

========32========

31 
The final columns set out the shares of LPG of various components.  What are  
the main findings?  First, the inclusion of intangibles lowers TFPG as a share of LPG.   
Consider  column  8  in  the  upper  panel.    TFPG  is  above  50%  of  LPG  without  
intangibles,  but  around  10  percentage  points  less  with  intangibles.    Second,  the  
contribution  of  the  “knowledge  economy”  to  LPG  is  very  significant,  whether  
measured as column 9 or 10.  In column 9, TFPG and intangible capital deepening are  
between  62%  and  72%  of  LPG,  with  the  fraction  particularly  large  in  1995-00.   
Column 10 adds the contribution of labour quality taking the figure to around 70%.   
Note how high this contribution is in the late 1990s when intangible capital deepening  
was very fast.   
We note that the decision on whether or not labour composition ought to be  
incorporated is subjective and so we leave it to the reader to decide on their preferred  
measure.  It could be argued that if changes in labour composition reflect changes in  
the gender or age composition of the workforce, the series does not fully reflect the  
acquisition of knowledge.  It turns out however that in practice the bulk of the quality  
adjustment  process  is  primarily  driven  by  qualifications,  with  age  (experience)  and  
gender playing much smaller roles.  
Growth accounting: further details and robustness checks  
As we have seen, we necessarily make a number of assumptions when implementing  
the  growth  accounting  exercise.  How  robust  are  our  findings  to  key  assumptions?   
This  is  shown  in  the  rest  of the  table,  where  for  easy  of  reading  we  just  show  the  
results for this century.  All results for all other periods are available. 

========33========

32 
The first row in Panel 2, TABLE 5, shows the results when only software is  
included  as  an  intangible.    Thus  this  row  corresponds  closely  to  current  National  
Accounts practice, although copyrights and mineral exploration are also capitalised in  
official data.  As can be seen, relative to the very top panel, which excludes software,  
capitalization  of  software raises Δln(V/H) and  lowers,  very  slightly, ΔlnTFP.    Note  
from  column  5  that  the  contribution  of  software  is  0.09%pa,  against  the  total  
intangible contribution of 0.51%pa.  
The next row capitalises both software and R&D and thus a comparison with  
the  software  line  estimates  the  difference  due  to  R&D  capitalization (to  be  
implemented  in  the  UK  by  2014).15    Relative  to  software,  the  contribution  of  
intangibles  rises  very  slightly  and  
ΔlnTFP falls  very  slightly.    So  capitalization  of  
R&D adds about 0.03%pa to input contribution and TFP falls by the same. 
The next two rows halve and double the assumed intangible depreciation rates.   
This raises and lowers the contribution of intangible capital respectively, as would be  
expected.    They  more  or  less  directly  affect  ΔlnTFP,  so  that,  if  for  example,  
intangibles depreciated half as fast as we have assumed, ΔlnTFP falls from 0.90%pa  
to 0.80%pa.   
Finally, since own account organizational capital is particularly uncertain, the  
final row reduces such spending by 75% (that is, managers are assumed to spend 5%  
of their time on organizational capital).  In this case contribution of intangible capital  
falls from 0.51%pa to 0.45% pa and ΔlnTFP rises from 0.90%pa to 0.93%pa. 
                                                       
15 
The  precise  details  of  this  capitalisation  are  to  be  confirmed,  but  we  have  used  similar  
depreciation and deflator assumptions to t he preliminary work in Galindo Rueda (2007). He  documents a fairly consistent rise in nominal GDP for 1997 -2004, of between 1.20 and 1.55%  (he does no growth accounting).  

========34========

33 
One  way  of  looking  at  the  robustness  of  these  results  is  to  calculate  the  
fraction of overall Δln(V/H) accounted for by intangibles, ΔlnTFP and Δln(L/H) under  
the various different scenarios.  It is in fact quite robust.  As row 3, top panel shows,  
without  intangibles,  the ΔlnTFP  fraction  is  0.53 or  and  (ΔlnTFP+Δln(L/H))  0.62,  a  
result  that  is  very  similar  with  just  software  or  just  software  and  R&D.    With  
intangibles, the fractions are 0.40 for ΔlnTFP, 0.63 for ΔlnTFP+Δln(K/H)(intan) and  
0.70 for ΔlnTFP+Δln(K/H)(intan)+Δln(L/H).  But the interesting thing to note is that  
these  fractions  are  almost  identical  with  the  experiments  on  depreciation  and  
organizational capital.  Thus the inclusion of the full range of intangibles lowers the  
share  of  the  contribution  of  ΔlnTFP,  but  consistently  raises  the  share  of  the  
contribution  of  ΔlnTFP,  intangible  capital  deepening  and  labour  composition  
combined, such that the latter has accounted for 70% of Δln(V/H) over this century.  
Contributions of individual intangible assets 
Appendix B, TABLE B.1., sets out the contributions of individual assets.  Between  
1990-2008, software is the largest contributor (0.16% p.a.), with organisational capital  
0.15%p.a..    R&D  contributes  0.05%  p.a..  In  the  late  1990s  the  contribution  of  
software (0.23% p.a.) came close to that of non-computer tangibles (0.25% p.a.), a  
remarkable result highlighting the importance of knowledge assets in that period.  
VI. Growth accounting results: industry-level  
Our  industry  growth  accounting  is  feasible between  2000-7.16    Thus  we  start  with  
comparing our aggregated market sector results with those using ONS data to check  
                                                       
16 
We have data based on the Supply -Use Tables back to 1992, but due to uncertainty a initial capital stocks we confine ourselves to growth accounting starting in 2000.

the two are closely comparable.  Then we look more closely industry by industry.  See  
Appendix A, TABLE A.2., for a comparison with ONS data. 
Results by industry  
To  build  up  the  industry  contributions  to  these  overall  figures  we  start  with  the  
industry-by-industry results in TABLE 6.    These are on a gross output basis: we show  
how they relate to the whole economy value-added level below.

We just report the results including all intangibles.  Column 1 shows ΔlnY/H,  
growth in gross output per employee-hour.  It is negative in Electricity, Gas, Water,  
otherwise  positive  particularly  in  manufacturing  and  Trade.    Column  2  shows  total  
capital  deepening  per  employee-hour,  being  strongly  positive  in  manufacturing  and  
business services, but negative in financial services.  Columns 3, 4 and 5 shed some  

========36========

35 
light  on  this.    The  contribution  of  computer  hardware  is  strongest  in financial  and  
business services, and note particularly weak in manufacturing.  The contribution of  
other tangibles (buildings, vehicles etc.) is actually negative in financial services, as is  
the contribution of intangibles in that industry.  It is worth noting that employee-hours  
are growing very fast in financial services (the second largest growth in the economy  
behind  business  services)  and  that  intangible  capital  is  falling  after  the  massive  
investment in the late 1990s.  So capital deepening per head is falling, thus rendering  
the contribution of growth in capital per hour negative.  Therefore we might expect  
that ΔlnTFP would  increase  when  intangibles  are  capitalised.    However,  since  the  
production  of  intangibles  on  own-account  is  incorporated  into  the  output  measure,  
capitalisation  also  slows  down  ΔlnY/H,  so  it  turns  out  that  ΔlnTFP still  falls  in  
financial  services  when we  add  intangibles  (see  TABLE  C.1,  without  intangibles,  
ΔlnTFP=1.51%): thus intangibles do help account for the TFP residual.  Columns 6  
and 7 show the contributions of labour composition and intermediates, and column 8  
shows  TFP  contribution.    ΔlnTFP grows  particularly  fast  in  finance  and  
manufacturing.  
So  the  overall  picture  of  intangibles  at  the  industry  level  is  as  follows.    In  
manufacturing, labour productivity is high, particularly with a lot of labour shedding.   
About 30% of that LPG is due to TFPG, with 15% due to intangible growth and 5%  
due to labour quality.  In financial services, measured labour productivity is lower, but  
TFP accounts for almost 90% of it.  The rest is due to labour quality and computers,  
with intangible investment intensity falling over the period.  So manufacturing is very  
much  driven  by  within-industry  intangible  investment,  whilst  finance  is  very  much 
driven by TFP (which could of course reflect within-industry spillovers of intangible  
investment).  In retailing, computers and intangibles account for around 19% of LPG. 

========37========

36 
Finally,  Appendix  C,  TABLE  C.1., shows  the  impact  of  adding  intangibles,  
which  is  that  ΔlnY/H is  higher  and  the  TFP  contribution  is  lower  than  without  
intangibles.  Thus for example, without intangibles one would conclude that the TFP  
contribution is 1.87% instead of 1.35% here.  
Contributions of individual industries overall performance 
The contribution of each industry to the overall market economy is a combination of  
their contributions within each industry and the weight of each industry in the market  
sector.    Thus  for  example,  there may  be  much  innovation  in  manufacturing  but  it  
might be a small sector in the market sector as a whole.  TABLE 7 sets this out.  
In the left panel columns 1, 2 and 3 show respectively the industry weights in  
market sector value added, average Δln(V/H) and the contribution to aggregate value  
added  (which  is  not  quite  the  product  of  columns  1  and  2,  since  the  average  of  a  
product is not the product of two averages).  In the final row, the weights on value  
added sum to unity and the sum of contributions is the market-sector total as shown in  
row 2 of TABLE A.2 in the appendix.  The middle panels show the capital and labour  
contributions  which  again  sum  to  the  market  sector  total.    The  right  panel  shows  
industry ΔlnTFP and its Domar weight, each industries contribution and confirms the  
weighted sum duplicates the aggregate.  Finally, as a memo item, column 14 shows  
employment as a fraction of the total.  The lower panel shows the contributions as a  
proportion of the total.

Notes: All figures are annual averages.  Growth rates and contributions are % pa per employee hour. Value-added  weights are the share of industry value-added in aggregate value-added. Input weights depend on the industry share in  aggregate value-added, the input share in gross output and the share of value-added in gross output. Domar weights  are the share of gross output in aggregate value-added. Contributions are the product of the corresponding weights  and the  growth rates averaged over  years (growth rates  for capital and labour inputs are  not shown in this table).   Employment is the share of the industry's hours worked over total hours worked by persons engaged.  
Source: Authors’ calculations. 
What  do  we  learn  about  the  economy  from  this  table?    Let  us  start  by  considering  
manufacturing.  As the top panel shows, column 1, its value added weight in the market sector is  
22%, although column 14 shows the employment weight is 19% (note these are higher than the  
shares in the whole economy which are the weights usually quoted).  Column 5 shows that the  
contribution of manufacturing capital deepening to aggregate capital deepening is 0.38%pa, which  
is  32%  of  the  total  (lower  panel).    Column  8  shows  that  the  contribution  of  intangibles  in  
manufacturing is significant: 51% (see lower panel) of the total intangible contribution. Columns  
10  and  13  show  the  contribution  of  labour  quality  and  TFP,  30%  and  41%  respectively  of  the  
total.  Finally, column 15 (lower panel), shows that manufacturing contributes 46% of the total  
contribution of intangible capital deepening and TFP.  Thus manufacturing, accounting for 22% of  
value added and 19% of employment, accounts for 51% of total intangible capital deepening and  
41% of TFP.  The importance of intangible investment in manufacturing of course suggests that a  
significant  component  of  the  activity  of  firms  allocated  to  manufacturing  in  the  SIC  is  the  
production of knowledge assets, which might be regarded as producing a service.  
What  of  other  industries?    The  other  large  contributions  of  capital  deepening  are  from  
retail  and  business  services.    Within  these,  ICT  capital  deepening  is  very  important  in  trade,  
whose  ICT  capital  deepening  accounts  for  42%  of  the  total.    Intangible  capital  deepening  in  
business services and trade accounts for 32% and 26% of the total as well. 
Turning  to  labour  composition,  manufacturing  and  trade  alone  account  for  50%  of  it.   
Finally, on TFP, after manufacturing, retail trade accounts for 26%, so that just these two sectors  
combined account for 61% of market sector TFP.  Finance and business services account for 35%.    

========40========

39 
Note that whilst the TFP growth of finance exceeds that of manufacturing, the Domar weight for  
finance is smaller, so the contribution to total TFP is much smaller. Retail has a much larger value  
added,  but  lower  TFP  growth  and  a  similar  Domar  weight  to  manufacturing,  so  the  trade  
contribution is lower.  
Finally,  one  might  summarise  these  results  by  asking  what  industries  account  for  the  
contribution of knowledge investment to Δln(V/H)?   If we define knowledge investment as the  
contributions of ΔlnTFP+sΔln(K/H)(intang) to the total, we see that manufacturing accounts for  
46%, trade 26%, business services 25% and financial services 6% (the numbers are very similar if  
we add sΔln(L/H), namely 41%, 27%, 22% and 12%).   
One important question is to ask how these results compare to those without intangibles.   
The results without intangibles are set out in the appendix, Table C.1, but the main results are as  
follows.  First, without intangibles, TFP contribution is 1.87 (against 1.35 above).  But note that  
the  contribution  above  of  TFP  and  intangible  capital  deepening  is  1.35+0.53  =  1.86,  almost  
exactly equal to TFP without intangibles, which accounts for 1.86/2.99= 62% of economic growth  
against  1.83/2.83=65%  without  intangibles.  So  in  this  calculation  the  total  “innovation”  
contribution turns out to about the same, but intangibles accounts about one-third of the residual.   
Second,  the  industry  contributions  are  different.  As  we  have  seen  here  with  intangibles,  
manufacturing  and  financial  services  account  for  46%  and  6%  of  final  innovation.    Without  
intangibles, manufacturing and financial services TFP account for 39% and 19% of Δln(V/H).  So  
without intangibles financial services TFP contribution is overstated.  
VII. Conclusions 
This  paper  tried  to  combine  a  number  of  threads  of  recent  work  on  the  rise  of  the  knowledge  
economy.    First,  analysis  of  ICT  suggested  that  computers  need  complementary  investment  in  
organizations, human capital and reputation.  Second, a growing perception that the knowledge  

========41========

40 
economy is becoming increasingly important has led to the treating of software and R&D in the  
national  accounts  as  investment.    To  study  the  questions  that  arise  we  have  used  the  CHS  
framework,  extended  its  measurement  method  somewhat  using  new  data  sets  and  a  new  micro  
survey, and implemented it on UK data for all intangibles in addition to R&D and software.  We  
have documented intangible investment in the UK and tried to see how it contributes to economic  
growth.  We find the following.  
i. 
Investment in knowledge.   
a) Investment in knowledge, which we call intangible assets, is now greater than  
investment  in  tangible  assets,  at  around,  in  2008,  £141bn  and  £104bn 
respectively,  16%  and  12%  of  MSGVA,  quantifying  the  UK  move  to  a  
knowledge-based economy.   
b) In  2008,  R&D  was  about  11%  of  total  intangible  investment,  software  15%,  
design  17%,    and  the  largest  categories  (22%)  training  and  organizational  
capital.  60% of intangible investment is own account. 
c) The most intangible-intensive industry is manufacturing (intangible investment  
as a proportion of value added is 20%).  Manufacturing, financial services and  
business services all invest about 3:1 on intangibles to tangibles.   
d) The effect of treating intangible expenditure as investment is to raise growth in  
market sector value added in the late 1990s (the internet investment boom), but  
slightly reduce growth in the 2000s.  
ii. 
Contribution to growth, 2000-08.   
a) For the most recent period of 2000-2008, intangible capital deepening accounts  
for 23% of growth in market sector value added per hour (Δln(V/H)), a larger  
contribution than computer hardware (12%), other tangible investments (18%,  

========42========

41 
buildings, vehicles, plant) or labour quality (7%).  The largest contribution is  
ΔlnTFP, being 40%.   
b) With  (without)  intangibles  Δln(V/H) 2.25%pa  (2.23%pa)  and  ΔlnTFP is  
0.90%pa  (1.19%pa).    Thus  adding  intangibles  to  growth  accounting  lowers  
ΔlnTFP and leaves Δln(V/H) unaffected. 
c) Capitalising R&D relative to the current practice of capitalizing software (plus  
mineral  exploration  and  artistic  originals)  adds  0.03%  to  input  growth  and  
reduces ΔlnTFP by 0.03%, with Δln(V/H) unaffected.   
d) If innovation is measured as ΔlnTFP plus the contribution of intangible capital  
deepening,  then  innovation  has  contributed  63%  of  growth  in  labour  
productivity with  intangibles  and  53%  without.    Adding  the  contribution  of  
labour composition gives 70% of Δln(V/H) with intangibles and 62% without.  
iii. 
Contribution by industries to growth.  The main finding here is the importance  
of  manufacturing,  which  accounts  for  just  over  40%  innovation  (measured  
either as intangible capital deepening plus TFP, or intangible capital deepening  
plus  TFP  plus  labour  quality)  in  the  UK  market  sector.    This  is  due  to  a  
combination  of  its  high  intangible  investment  (51%  of  total  intangible  
contribution) and TFP (41% of total contribution), even though manufacturing  
is a comparatively small sector in terms of employment share (19% of market  
sector  employment).    We  also  find  important  contributions  of  
retail/hotels/transport,  accounting  for 27%  of  innovation,  business  services  
contributes 25% and finance 6%. 
In future work, we hope to improve the measures of all variables.  We also wish to explore  
policy and the total contributions of various assets by looking for spillovers.  So, for example, it is  

========43========

42 
quite conceivable that R&D spillovers will greatly amplify the contribution of R&D to economic  
growth.

Comparison with ONS data 
To form ONS data on value added and capital services, we use industry level ONS value added  
and  capital  services  data  and  add  up  sectors  A  to  K,  subtracting  off  residential  real  estate,  as  
described above.  How do the KLEMS data compare with the disaggregated ONS data?  The real  
output data are almost exactly the same, as are the capital services data.  The labour input data are  
different.  First, the KLEMS data has fewer workers in financial services, but more in business  
services than the ONS data.  We suspect this may be due to the treatment of agency workers of  
whom there are many in financial services, but employed by agencies in business services and  
hence their appropriate treatment is a problem.  This means that productivity growth in financial  
services is much higher in KLEMS relative to the ONS, but somewhat less in business services.   
Second, the KLEMS labour composition series grows faster than the ONS series. 
Comparing growth-accounting results using aggregated KLEMS industry data with results  
using ONS data  
Our market sector results in the paper are to 2008, based on ONS data.  To compare with KLEMS,  
we set out the growth accounting results for the market sector to 2007.  TABLE A.2 sets out our  
results.    The top row shows the use of ONS data, with intangibles, 2000-7.  The second row shows  
the  results  for  2000-7,  with  intangibles,  using  the  aggregated  industry  data.    Δln(V/H) is  13  
percentage  points  higher  with  EUKLEMS,  but  the  contribution  of  Δln(L/H) is  14  percentage  
points higher, with ΔlnTFP very similar.  So the results are quite comparable.

Notes: All figures are average annual percentages. The contribution of an output or input is the growth rate weighted  by the  corresponding average share.  Columns are  annual  average  change  in natural logs of value  added per hour  (column  1),  contribution  of total  capital  (column  2,  which  is  the  sum  of  the  next  three  columns),  contribution  of  computer  capital  (column  3),  contribution  of  other  non-computer  tangible  capital  (column  4),  contribution  of  intangibles (column 5) contribution of labour composition per hour (column 6), TFP (column 7, being column 3 less  the  sum of column 4 and column 8).   Row 1 is based on ONS data  with the capitalisation of intangibles for the  market sector.  Row 2 is EUKLEMS data, with intangibles, 2000-7, aggregated to the market sector.  In each dataset  the market sector is defined using our definition of SIC(2003) A-K excluding dwellings

Appendix B: Contributions of individual assets to market sector LPG 
Contributions of each intangible asset are set out in Table B.1.  Column 5 shows that software is  
an important driver, with a very strong contribution in the 1990s of between 0.18% and 0.23%  
p.a., but less so this century, contributing 0.10% p.a.. Note that in the late 1990s the contribution  
of  software  came  close  to  that  of  non-computer  tangibles,  a  remarkable  result  highlighting  the  
importance  of  knowledge  assets.  Column  6  shows  a  small  contribution  for  mineral  exploration  
and artistic originals.  Columns 7 and 8 show the contribution of design to be above that of R&D  
in the most recent period, at around 0.09% p.a., with R&D at 0.05% p.a. (this is larger than that  
what can be inferred from the main text since it includes R&D in financial services and social  
sciences).  In columns 8 to 12, we show the contribution of advertising and marketing, training  
and organisational capital.  Organisational capital is the most important here, particularly in the  
2000s, with training important in the early decade in particular.

Notes:    Data are average growth rates per hour per year for intervals shown. First column is value-added labour productivity growth in per hour terms.  Column 2 is the contribution of labour composition, namely growth in labour services per hour times share of labour in MGVA.  Column 3 is growth in computer capital services per hour  times share in MGVA.  Column 4 is growth in other tangible capital services per hour (buildings, plant, vehicles) times share in MGVA.  Column 5 is growth in software  capital services per hour times share in MGVA.  Column 6 is growth in capital services from mineral exploration and copyright per hour times share in MGVA. Column 7 is  capital services from design per hour times share in GVA. Column 8 is growth in broadly defined R&D (including non-scientific R&D and financial product development)  capital services per hour times share in GVA. Column 9 is capital services from advertising and market research per hour times share in MGVA Column 10 is capital services  from firm-level training per hour times share in MGVA. Column 11 is organisational capital services per hour times share in MGVA. Column 12 is TFP, namely column 1  minus the sum of columns 2 to 11.  Column 13 is the share of labour payments in MGVA.

Appendix C: Excluding intangibles, industry contributions to growth in aggregate value added,  
capital deepening, labour quality and TFP, 2000-7 
TABLE  C.1  re-produces  TABLE  7  except  it  excludes  intangibles.    The  contribution  of  each  
industry  to  the  overall  market  economy  is  a  combination  of  their  contributions  within  each  
industry and the weight of each industry in the market sector.  Thus for example, there may be  
much tangible capital deepening in a particular sector, but it might be a small sector in the market  
sector as a whole.   
In  the  left  panel  columns  1,  2  and  3  show  respectively  the  industry  weights  in  market  
sector value added, average Δln(V/H) and the contribution to aggregate value added (which is not  
quite the product of columns 1 and 2, since the average of a product is not the product of two  
averages).  The middle panels show the capital and labour contributions which again sum to the  
market sector total.  The right panel shows industry ΔlnTFP and its Domar weight, each industries  
contribution and confirms the weighted sum duplicates the aggregate.  Finally, as a memo item,  
column 13 shows employment as a fraction of the total.  The lower panel shows the contributions  
as a proportion of the total.
