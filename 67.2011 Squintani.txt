Abstract 
This paper applies mechanism design to con resolution. We determine when and how unmediated communication and mediation reduce the ex ante probability of con in a game with asymmetric information. Mediation improves upon un- mediated communication when the intensity of con is high, or when asymmetric information is signit. The mediator improves upon unmediated communication by not precisely reporting information to con parties, and precisely, by not revealing to a player with probability one that the opponent is weak. Arbitrators who can enforce settlements are no more ee than mediators who only make non-binding recommendations. 
1 Introduction 
Over the years, the formal theory of international relations has much developed the pos- 
itive analysis of con by making use of advanced game theoretical techniques.1 Instead, 
the powerful tools of mechanism design have not yet been extensively used to explore which

institutions may be more ee for con resolution and prevention.2 The revelation 
principle, a fundamental result in mechanism design due to Myerson (1979), identi me- 
diation as an et institution to deal with con that arise because of asymmetric 
information, one of the main rationalist explanations for wars.3 
Indeed, mediation has 
played an increasingly important role in the organization of peace talks to resolve recent 
international crises. According to the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) project, the 
most comprehensive empirical e to date, 30% of international crises for the entire pe- 
riod 1918{2001 were mediated, and the fraction rises to 46% for the period 1990{2001 (see 
Wilkenfeld et al., 2005). In a simple model of con this paper  asks when, and how, 
mediation improves the ex ante probability of peace with respect to unmediated peace 
talks.4 Second, we ask whether arbitration improves on mediation, to explore the relevance 
of the power of enforcing settlements in international con resolution.5 
Before describing our speci set up and  we brie motivate our general mod- 
elling choices. 
In line with the mechanism design literature, we consider unbiased mediators who have 
no private information.6 Further, the mediator’s objective is the minimization of the ex-ante 
2A few papers study mechanism design in international relations (Bester and Warneryd, 2006, and Fey and Ramsay 2009, 2010); we discuss them later in details. A discussion on the importance of institutional design for con or international cooperation is in Koremenos et al (2001). 
3Blainey (1988) famously argued that wars begin when states disagree about their relative power and end when they agree again (see also Brito and Intriligator, 1985, and Fearon, 1995). Wars may arise because of asymmetric information about military strength, but also about the value of outside options or about the contestants’ political resolve, i.e. about the capability of the leaders and the peoples to sustain war. For example, it is known that Saddam Hussein grossly under-estimated the US administration political resolve, when invading Kuwait in 1990. 
4The role of communication in reducing the probability of con due to asymmetric information is established by Baliga and Sjostrom (2004). 
5As well as international con the intuition that private information may cause bargaining failures has been invoked as an explanation for costly trials in the case of litigation, and strikes in the case of wage bargaining (see Kennan and Wilson, 1993, for an early review). But unlike in international relations, where nations are sovereign, arbitration is always possible in these contexts; and hence the study of mediation has not been much developed. Further, most of the analysis has focused on the performance of currently available arbitration mechanisms in speci game theoretic models, rather than characterizing optimal arbitration, which is the scope of mechanism design analysis. 
6As some scholars claim, \mediator impartiality is crucial for disputants’ con in the mediator, which, in turn, is a necessary condition for his gaining acceptability, which, in turn, is essential for mediation success to come about" (see e.g. Young, 1967, and the scholars mentioned in Kleiboer, 1996). On the other

probability of war. Hence, our mediator must be able to commit to quit in some circum- 
stances, instead seeking a peaceful agreement in all contingencies (see Watkins, 1998). Such 
commitments, in fact, facilitate information disclosure by the contestants, and ultimately 
improve the ex-ante chances of peaceful con resolution.7 Finally, we study mediators 
who have no independent budget for transfers or subsidies, and cannot impose peace to the 
contestants. To be sure, third-party states that mediate con such as the United States, 
are neither unbiased nor powerless; However, single states account for less than a third of 
the mediators in mediated con (Wilkenfeld, 2005), so that we view our assumption 
not only as a useful theoretical benchmark, but also as a reasonable approximation for 
numerous instances of mediated crises. 
Unlike most of the mechanism design literature, we assume that the mediator’s proposals 
must be self-enforcing.8 Indeed, countries are sovereign, and enforcement of contracts or 
agreements is often impossible in international relations (see e.g. Waltz, 1959).9 
This 
assumption is formalized by introducing ex post individual rationality constraints requiring 
that both contestants  proposed peaceful settlements more advantageous than starting 
con In the terminology of Fisher (1995), our mediators perform \pure mediation," 
i.e., they gather information and propose settlements, rather than \power mediation," 
which also involves mediator’s power to reward, punish or enforce. In order to describe 
the di between arbitration and mediation, in the  section, we relax ex post 
individual rationality and introduce standard ex interim individual rationality constraints. 
To achieve their objectives, mediators can facilitate communication, formulate propos- 
hand, when a mediator possesses independent information that needs to be credibly transmitted, some degree of bias may be optimal (see Kydd, 2003, Rauchaus, 2006). 
7In the  discussion, we provide some anecdotal evidence supporting our assumption of full mediator’s commitment, which is obviously also one of our normative prescriptions. 
8Among the few papers studying self-enforcing mechanisms, see Matthews and Postlewaite (1989), Banks and Calvert (1992), Cramton and Palfrey (1995), Forges (1999), Compte and Jehiel (2008), and Goltsman et al. (2009). 
9Viewed another way, countries cannot commit not to initiate war if such an attack is a pro devia- tion from an agreement. In this sense, even if the bargaining problem comes from asymmetric information, we also have a natural form of commitment problem built in. See Powell (2006) for a recent comprehensive discussion of the relative importance of asymmetric information and commitment problems in creating bargaining breakdown.

als, and manipulate the information transmitted (see Touval and Zartman, 1985, for a 
discussion of these three roles; and Wall and Lynn, 1993, for an exhaustive discussion 
of all observed mediation techniques). Because we consider unmediated cheap talk as a 
benchmark, our mediators can only improve the chances of peace by managing the w 
of information between the parties. In practice, this corresponds to the mediator’s role in 
\collecting and judiciously communicating select contial material" (Rai 1982, 108{ 
109). Obviously, this activity requires private and separate caucuses. Indeed, the practice 
of shuttle diplomacy has become popular since Henry Kissinger’s e in the Middle East 
in the early 1970s and the Camp David negotiations mediated by Jimmy Carter, in which a 
third party conveys information back and forth between parties, providing suggestions for 
moving the con toward resolution (see, for example, Kydd, 2006). In the real world, me- 
diators also often prevent con by facilitating communication or coordinating discussions 
among parties unwilling to communicate without a mediator. Such instances of mediation 
correspond to what we formally call unmediated communication. Our paper con the 
value of mediators as communication facilitators, by showing that communication often 
reduces the chance of con 
Having clari our methodological choices and our general motivation, we now describe 
the basic features of our model and then o a preview of our

sources.10 A player cannot observe the opponent’s strength, political resolve, or willingness 
to t. Speci, each player is strong (hawk) with some probability and weak (dove) 
otherwise. If the two players are of the same type, war is a fair lottery; else, the stronger 
wins with higher probability. For simplicity, we assume that all wars are equally costly.11 
10This is a standard metaphor for many types of wars, for example related to territorial disputes or to the present and future sharing of the rents from the extraction of natural resources. Indeed, Bercovitch et al (1991) show that mediation is useful mostly when the disputes are about resources, territory, or in any case divisible issues. 
11It might be interesting to allow for dit costs for symmetric and asymmetric wars, but the addi- tional notational and computational costs appear a heavy price to pay.

========5========

We consider a simple game where the two players simultaneously choose whether to agree 
to a given resource split, and war takes place unless both players agree. For any value of 
the split, we calculate the equilibrium that maximizes the ex ante chances of peace. Then, 
we choose values of the split that maximize the peace chances.12 
In order to introduce unmediated communication, we augment our basic model by 
letting the peaceful split parameter depend on cheap-talk messages priorly shared by the 
players, and on the realization of a public randomization device. Indeed, it is known 
that public randomization devices may be reproduced by simultaneous cheap talk (see, 
Aumann and Hart, 2003). When war cannot be avoided in our benchmark model, the 
optimal separating communication equilibrium is shown to improve on no-communication. 
Intuitively, it allows players to reveal their type, and establish type-dependent splits to 
avoid con However, war cannot be fully avoided.13 
We then consider mediated communication. First, the mediator collects the players’ 
messages privately. Then, she optimally chooses message-dependent split proposals, possi- 
bly randomizing.14 Given these de we can now report our main results. 
- When does a mediator help? The mediator’s optimal solution cannot be worse than 
any equilibrium without the mediator. In fact, the mediator could always, trivially, 
make the messages she receives public, thereby mimicking the optimal unmediated 
communication equilibrium. Further, the mediator strictly improves the peace chance 
in two distinct sets of circumstances. First, when the intensity (or cost) of con is 
12One of the mediator’s role in our model will be to make peaceful split recommendations after hearing the players’ private report. By selecting the split values that induce equilibria with the highest chance of peace in our benchmark, we isolate the information management role of the mediator from her split proposal role. 
13In a small parameter region, in which the cost of war is high, the players can improve on the sep- arating equilibrium, by playing a mixed strategy equilibrium in the cheap talk game. Of course, mixed strategy equilibria are strictly dominated by mediation, as mixed strategies induce randomizations inde- pendent across players, instead of the optimally correlated randomizations chosen by the mediator (see, e.g. Aumann, 1974). 
14The model by Banks and Calvert (1992) can be related to our construction. They also compare the solution of self-enforcing mediation to what can be achieved without a mediator in an underlying two- by-two game. But their underlying game is very dit from our game of con They consider a coordination game with incomplete information.

high. Second, when the intensity of con is low, but the uncertainty regarding the 
disputants’ strength is high.15 
- How does the mediator help? 
When con intensity is high, the mediator can 
improve upon unmediated communication by o unequal splits even when she 
observes both players reporting to be doves. This is equivalent to an obfuscation 
strategy by which the mediator does not reveal with probability one to a self-declared 
dove that she is facing a dove. When the intensity is low but uncertainty is high, 
the mediator’s strategy involves proposing equal split settlements even when she 
receives dit messages. Equivalently, the mediator does not always reveal to a 
self-declared hawk that she is facing a dove. 
Although it is widely believed that a successful mediator should issue credible reports 
to the con parties, we  that such a reporting strategy would be sub-optimal. 
Speci (and realistically), the mediator should not always reveal that a player is 
weak, when this is the case. 
- Does arbitration improve on mediation? Surprisingly, we  that an arbitrator who 
can enforce settlements is no more ee in preventing con than a mediator 
who can only propose self-enforcing agreements.16 Our results are in line with the 
view that a mediator should not necessarily need enforcement power: \A mediated 
settlement that arises as a consequence of the use of leverage may not last very 
long because the agreement is based on compliance with the mediator and not on 
internalization of the agreement-changed attitudes and perceptions" (Kelman, 1958). 
15Interestingly, the intensity of con and asymmetric information are considered among the most important variables that a when mediation is most successful (see e.g. Bercovitch and Houston, 2000, and Bercovitch et al., 1991). Our  resonate with well-documented stylized facts in the empirical literature on negotiation (Bercovich and Jackson 2001, Wall and Lynn, 1993), that show that parties are less likely to reach an agreement without a mediator when the intensity of con is high than when it is low. Rauchhaus (2006) provides quantitative analysis showing that mediation is especially ee when it targets asymmetric information. 
16This result is in contrast with  in other environments (e.g., Cramton and Palfrey, 1995, Compte and Jehiel, 2008, or Goltsman et al., 2009).

========7========

We conclude the introduction by discussing a few papers that, like us, study mechanism 
design in international con The basic game of con and arbitration model studied 
in this paper are binary versions of the model by Bester and Warneryd (2006), who, unlike 
us, do not solve the more involved mediation and unmediated communication problem. Fey 
and Ramsay (2009) establish simple sut conditions for mediation and communication 
to achieve peace with probability one; unlike us, do not characterize optimal mechanisms 
when they do not yield peace with probability one.17 Fey and Ramsay (2010) show that 
mediation and unmediated communication yield the same outcomes in the special case when 
all private information concerns only one’s cost of ting. Ours is the  paper that 
solves the optimal mediation and unmediated communication problem in a game of con 
where each player’s private information includes features that bear direct implications on 
the outcome of war, such as military strength, political resolve, or preference for ting. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our basic model of con 
Section 3 studies unmediated communication. Section 4 solves optimal mediation. Section 
5 compares mediation and arbitration. The  section o some concluding comments. 
In particular, it discusses interim mechanism selection, mediator’s commitment and con- 
testants’ renegotiation. All proofs are in appendices. 
2 The Game of Con 
Two players contest a cake of size normalized to one.18 War shrinks the value of the 
cake to  < 1. The expected payo in case of war depends on both players’ private types. 
Each player can be of type H or L with probability q and (1 
 q), respectively.19 
This 
17Another di is that unlike them we impose sequential rationality after every history, including after deviations, as it a incentives at the reporting stage (see for instance Green and Lat, 1987 for the importance of applying sequential rationality after every history). 
18Depending on the context, of course, the interpretation of the cake ranges from territory or exploitation of natural resources to any measure of social surplus in a country or partnership. 
19To simplify the analysis, and keep the problem’s dimensionality in check, we adopt a fully symmetric model. We believe that our results will hold approximately, for models that are close to symmetric.

private characteristic can be thought of as related to resolve, military strength, leaders’ 
stubbornness, etc. We will often refer to type H as a \hawk" and to a L type as a \dove" 
(with no reference to the hawk-dove game). When the two players are of the same type, 
the expected share of the cake in case of war is 1=2 for both. When a type H player ts 
against an L type, her expected share of the cake is p > 1=2; and hence her expected 
payo is p: If p < 1=2; the problem is trivial as con can always be averted with the 
anonymous split (1=2;1=2); we shall therefore assume henceforth that p > 1=2: 
We consider a simple \agreement" game where the two players simultaneously choose 
whether to agree to a given cake division (x;1 
 x); where x 2 [0;1] is a parameter of 
the game. Unless both players agree to the split, war takes place.20 
We assume that 
when the two players accept a peaceful split, this prevents war.21 For any value of the 
split, we calculate the equilibria that maximize the ex ante chances of peace. Then, we 
choose values of the split that maximize the peace chance, which will be denoted by V , 
the value. Our benchmark model is therefore directly comparable with the mediation and 
unmediated communication programs that we will later describe in details. In fact, it can 
be reformulated as a simple program where the split x 2 [0;1] is chosen so as to maximize 
peace chances, subject to ex-post individual rationality constraints only, without allowing 
players the possibility to communicate. 
The model has three parameters: ; p, and q. Yet, it turns out that a more parsimonious 
20Even though simultaneous decisions to go to war are sequentially rational in all circumstances, one could conceive other game forms with sequential decisions to accept or reject an agreement, and in such game forms one could intuitively expect a lower frequency of war. Since this intuition about alternative game forms can apply only for the game without communication and for unmediated communication, while with mediation the order of play is irrelevant, it follows that our choice of game form, if anything, stacks the deck against the mediator, hence making our conclusions to follow on the importance of mediation robust to changes in the underlying game. 
21If the cake is a resource that can be depleted in a short period and does not have spillovers on relative strength, then there is no commitment problem. If the cake sharing is instead to be interpreted as a durable agreement for example on the exploitation of a future stream of resources or gains from trade, then the commitment problem is non trivial. In this case the agreement could be about periodic tributes to be made in perpetuity, and there are ways to implement the agreement with sut use of dynamic incentives. See for example Schwartz and Sonin (2008).

: 
The parameter  is the hawk/dove odds ratio, and   0 represents the ratio of bene 
over cost of war for a hawk: the numerator is the gain for waging war against a dove instead 
of accepting the equal split, and the denominator is the loss for waging war against a hawk 
rather than accepting equal split. Given that  is increasing in , we will also interpret 
situations with low  as situations of high intensity or cost of con 
Armed with this simpli we can now calculate the splits (x;1 
 x) and equilibria 
in the consequent war-declaration game that maximize the ex ante probability of peace. 
First, note that for q=2+(1 
 q)p  1=2; or   ; both doves and hawks choose peace in 
the peace-maximizing equilibrium of the game with x = 1=2: When  < ; the probability 
of peace is maximized by setting x so that all doves play peace, together with the hawk 
type of one of the two players. This is achieved by setting x  p; so as to convince the 
hawk type of player 1 to play peace, against a player 2 who plays peace if and only if dove, 
and 1 
 x  (1 
 q)=2 + q (1 
 p); so as to convince the dove type of player 2 to play 
peace, against a player 1 who always plays peace. These two inequalities are both satis 
for some x if and only if (1

setting x = 1=2 so that doves play peace, and hawks declare war.

3 Communication Without Mediation 
Communication Game 
In order to study the value of unmediated communication, 
we augment our basic model as follows. After privately learning her type, each player i 
sends a message mi 2 fl; hg: The two messages are sent simultaneously. After observing 
each other’s message, the players play a speci of the agreement game, where the 
split x may depend on the messages m = (m1; m2) and on the realization of a public 
randomization device. Speci, we assume that with probability 1  p(m) a split x(m) is 
selected that induces war as the unique equilibrium of the agreement game, e.g., x(m) = 0: 
With probability p(m), the split x(m) is selected so as to induce peace in equilibrium. We 
calculate the optimal values of the peaceful splits x() and the probabilities p() subject to 
the constraints that players are willing to use the equilibrium communication and agreement 
strategies. 
Before proceeding with the analysis, we brie comment on the characteristics of our 
communication protocol. Relative to the benchmark without communication, we have 
introduced one round of binary cheap talk, and a public randomization device. Following 
Aumann and Hart (2003), such a public randomization device can be replicated by an 
additional round of communication (using so-called jointly controlled lotteries). Hence our 
game can be reformulated as a two-round communication game without any extraneous 
randomization device. For the sake of tractability, we do not consider the possibility of 
further rounds of cheap talk.23 
The restriction to binary messages is natural given the 
binary type space. When focusing on pure-strategy equilibria, this restriction is without 
loss of generality. But it is possible that more messages might help in mixed-strategy 
equilibria (numerical optimization shows that allowing for three messages does not help). 
On the other hand, the restriction to a single peaceful split x(m), for every m; rather than 
the consideration of a lottery over peaceful splits, is without loss of generality.24 
23This might help, however. Aumann and Hart (2003) provide examples of games in which longer, indeed unbounded, communication protocols improve upon  round communication. 
24Note that can replace without loss any lottery over peaceful recommendations with its certainty equiv- 
10 

========11========

Pure-strategy Equilibria. 
We momentarily ignore mixed strategies by the players 
at the message stage. Those will be considered in the next subsection. Evidently, there is 
always a pooling equilibrium in which both types choose the same reporting strategy, whose 
outcomes coincide with the equilibrium of the agreement game without communication. We 
now consider separating equilibrium, i.e., equilibrium in which each player truthfully reveals 
her type. 
Let us consider here only equilibria with peaceful splits x(m) and probabilities p(m) 
that are symmetric across players. Such symmetry restriction entails that x(h; h) = x(l; l) = 
1=2, and that we only need to  another split value, i.e., b  x(h; l) = 1 
 x(l; h), given 
that the message space contains only two elements. We shall later see that this restriction 
is without loss of generality, because the separating equilibrium which minimizes the ex 
ante probability of peace is calculated by solving a linear program.25 To shorten notation 
further, we let pL  p(l; l); pH  p(h; h) and pM  p(h; l) = p(l; h). 
Armed with these de the optimal separating equilibrium is characterized by 
the following program. Maximize the peace probability 
min (1b;pL;pM;pH 
 q)2(1 
 pL) + 2q(1 
 q)(1 
 pM) + q2(1 
 pH)

tive compatibility constraints (ICL; ICH).26 First, reporting truthfully must be optimal. 
alent. In fact, at the agreement stage, the requirement that the players accept such a deterministic average split is less stringent than the requirement that they accept all splits in the support of the lottery. Fur- ther, lotteries over peaceful splits a each player’s equilibrium payo at the communication stage only through their expectations. Finally, the payo of a player who deviates at the communication stage is convex in the recommended split, as we shall later see. Hence, the deviation payo is lower when replacing a lottery with its certainty equivalent, thus making the equilibrium requirement less stringent. 
25We will see that each player’s constraints are linear in the maximization arguments. Thus, the con- straint set is convex. Hence, suppose that an asymmetric mechanism maximizes the probability of peace. Because the set-up is symmetric across players, the anti-symmetric mechanism, obtained by interchanging the players’ identities, is also optimal. But then, the constraint set being convex, it contains also the symmetric mechanism obtained by mixing the above optimal mechanisms. As the objective function is linear in the maximization argument, such symmetric mixed mechanism is also optimal. 
26The \star" superscript refers to the fact that, when a player contemplates deviating at the message stage, she also anticipates and takes into account that she might prefer to declare war ex post, even when players are supposed to coordinate on peace. This explains the maxima on the right-hand side of the two

strength. When the opponent is dove, the split b is recommended with probability pM: In 
principle, the player may deviate from the recommendation, and collect the war payo =2; 
hence the payo is maxfb; =2g: Further, war takes place with probability 1

the opponent is hawk, the split 1=2 is recommended with probability pH; and war occurs

Second, players must  it optimal to accept all peaceful splits. Given that, in a

peaceful split. 
27Even though the constraints (IC  
L) and (IC H) are not linear because of the maxima and of the products pMb; they can be turned into linear constraints as follows. First, one replaces each constraint with four constraints in which the left-hand sides equal the left-hand side of the original constraint with one of the four pairs of the arguments of the two maxima, in lieu of the maxima. Second, one changes the variable b with pB = pMb and the constraint 1=2  b  1 with pB  pM  2pB:

That is, a hawk facing a self-proclaimed dove must get a share b that makes war unpro

for her to go to war. The constraint that a player would accept an equal split when the 
opponent’s type is the same as her own, 1=2 > =2; is always satis 
Solving this program yields the following characterization. We here omit the precise 
equilibrium formula, presented in the Appendix, as it is quite burdensome.

We now elaborate on the characterization described above. 
First, the separating equilibrium always improves upon the agreement game without 
communication. While intuitive, this result is far from obvious: While at least one equilib- 
rium of the communication game must be at least as good as the optimal agreement game 
equilibrium, it is not an obvious implication that the separating equilibrium would strictly 
improve upon all equilibria without communication. 
Second, war is never optimal when both players report low strength: pL = 1; intuitively, 
there is no need to punish self-reported doves by means of war, as they receive lower splits 
on average than if reporting to be hawks. 
Third, the truth-telling constraint for the low type, ICL, is always binding, because 
on average hawks receive higher peaceful splits than doves. Given that the incentive to 
exaggerate strength must be discouraged, there needs to be positive probability of war 
following a high report. The most potent channel through which the low type’s incentive 
to exaggerate strength can be kept in check is by assigning a positive probability of war 
whenever there are two self-proclaimed high types. When  is low (few high types) it is 
indeed optimal to set pH = 0 and pM > 0, whereas for higher values of , pH < 1 and 
pM = 1: When  is sutly high, the likelihood of a hawk is sutly high that 
prescribing war against a dove is not needed to deter a dove to exaggerate strength. But 
when  is low, deterring misreporting by a dove requires having self-reported hawks t 
both against hawks and doves, with positive probability. 
Fourth, when the truth-telling constraint for the high type, ICH, is not binding, then 
b = p; and when both truth-telling constraints are binding, then the ex post IR constraint 
b  p does not bind. Hence, b is either pinned down by the ex post IR constraint b  p; or 
by the joint ex interim truth-telling constraints. Intuitively, both (ICH) and the constraint 
b  p need b sutly large to be satis On the other hand, keeping in check the 
(binding) constraint (ICL) requires keeping b as low as possible. Hence b will be such that 
either ICH binds, or b = p: 
14 

========15========

The other properties of the characterization of Proposition 1 are best described by 
distinguishing the cases   1 and  < 1. 
Suppose  that   1, so that the bene from war are sutly high. Then 
the ex post IR constraint always binds, and hence b = p; and the ex interim high-type 
truth-telling ICH constraint never binds. This is because the hawk hiding strength always 
prefers to wage war (both against hawks and doves). When b = p, the condition   1 
is equivalent to 1 
 b  =2: As a result, the hawk obtains the payo p against doves, 
regardless of her message, whereas against hawks she obtains =2 if hiding strength, and 
either =2 (after a war recommendation) or 1=2 (after settlement) when truthfully reporting. 
In sum, hawks receive a higher payo if revealing their type, and the ICH constraint never 
binds. 
Second, suppose that  < 1. For   1=(1 + ), the high-type truth-telling constraint 
ICH binds, and b > p. To see why, suppose by contradiction that b = p: For  < 1; 
this would imply that 1 
 b > =2: Consider a hawk pretending to be a dove. If she meets 
a dove, she can secure the payo p by waging war. This is also the payo for revealing 
being hawk and meeting a dove: She obtains p through war or through the split b = p: If 
she meets a hawk, she gets 1 
 b with probability pM and =2 with probability 1 
 pM. By 
claiming to be a hawk, she gets 1=2 with probability pH and =2 with probability 1 
 pH. 
But we know that pM is larger than pH; and because 1 
 b > =2; this gives an incentive to 
pretend to be a dove (hiding strength) to secure peace more often than by revealing that 
she is a hawk, which contradicts ICH. To make sure that both truth-telling constraints 
are satis we must have b > p, so as to reduce the payo from hiding strength. This 
reduces both the payo from settling against a hawk when hiding strength and the payo 
from settling against a dove when revealing to be hawk. 
To see why b = p when  2 [1=(1 + ); ]; even if  < 1; note that pH increases in , 
as in the case of   1. Because the incentive to hide strength decreases as pH increases 
relative to pM, we can reduce b as  increases. When  reaches the threshold 1=(1 + ), 
15 

========16========

the o b required for the high type truth-telling constraint to bind is exactly p. Further 
increasing  cannot induce a further decrease in b, because the ex post IR constraint b  p 
becomes binding. So in the region where  2 [1=(1 + ); ], the ICH constraint does not 
bind and b = p. 
We conclude this subsection by discussing the probability of peace in the best separating 
equilibrium, pictured in Figure 1. For   1; it is U-shaped in  for   =2; and decreasing 
in  when  is between =2 and . To understand the forces leading to the U-shaped e 
of  in the lower region, note  that an increase in  shifts probability mass from the 
LL dyad to the LH dyad and from the LH dyad to the HH dyad (the overall e on 
the likelihood of the LH dyad is that it increases in  if and only if  < 1): Because 
1 = pL  pM > pH; these shifts make the probability of peace initially decrease in  
However, pM strictly increases in  for   =2; and eventually this makes the probability 
of peace increase in . Interestingly, despite the fact that pH strictly increases in , for 
 > = 2; it still does not grow fast enough to compensate for the shift in probability mass 
towards the dyads with the higher probability of war. As a result, the probability of peace 
decreases in  when  is between =2 and .

Mixed-strategy Equilibria. 
This subsection considers mixed strategy equilibria. 
Mixing can help, though its role in the unmediated communication game is relatively lim-

ited (compare Figure 1 and right panel of Figure 2). The following result states that, while 
there is no mixed-strategy equilibrium in which the hawk randomizes between sending the 
high and low report, there exists a mixed-strategy equilibrium in which the dove random- 
izes.28 Furthermore, in some parameter region, depicted in the right panel of Figure 2, such 
a mixed strategy equilibrium yields a higher ex ante peace probability than the separating 
equilibrium. The speci de of the region in which mixing improves upon the sepa- 
rating equilibrium is rather cumbersome, as is the explicit description of the mixed-strategy 
equilibrium, and so it is relegated to the Appendix. But it is interesting to note that mixing 
may improve only in a small subset of the parameter region in which both ex interim IC* 
constraints bind: mixing by the dove may relax the incentive of the hawk to hide strength. 
We summarize our  as follows. 
Proposition 2 Allowing for mixed strategies in the unmediated communication game, the 
best equilibrium is such that the hawk always sends message h and the dove sends l with 
probability strictly less than one. 
The probability  < 1 with which the dove sends l is reported in appendix, and shown 
in the right panel of Figure 2.

4 Mediation 
In the previous section, we have characterized the optimal equilibrium in the case in 
which players send public messages. In this section, we consider mediated communication. 
We modify the game form to account for such a mediator. In the  stage, messages 
are no longer public. They are separately reported to a mediator, who then proposes the 
split, possibly at random. More precisely, the version of the revelation principle proved in 
Myerson (1982) guarantees that the following game form entails no loss of generality: 
- After being informed of her type, each player i privately sends a report mi 2 fl; hg 
to the mediator. 
- Given reports m = (m1; m2), the mediator recommends a split (b;1 
 b) according 
to some cumulative distribution function F(bjm); where the only recommendation 
leading to war in the support of F (m) is b = 0:29 Unlike the reports, the mediator’s 
recommendation is public. 
- The contestants play the agreement game with the recommended split b: 
Again by the revelation principle, we may restrict attention to distributions F such that 
truthful type revelation and obedience to the mediator’s recommendation are part of the 
equilibrium. As before, this imposes both ex interim incentive compatibility constraints and 
ex post individual rationality constraints, which we now describe. To simplify notation, we 
restrict attention to mechanisms that are symmetric across players, where F (m1; m2) = 
1 
 F (m2; m1) for all (m1; m2), and to discrete distributions F: We shall later see that 
these restrictions entail no loss of generality. 
Let Pr[m 
 i; b; mi] denote the equilibrium joint probability that the players send mes- 
sages (mi; m 
 i) and that the mediator o 
(b;1 
 b), and set Pr[b; mi]  Pr[h; b; mi] + 
29Clearly all recommendation leading to war induce the same payo and hence can be subsumed by the recommendation b = 0; which only induces war in the agreement game. This feature of the model should not be taken literally. In the real world, mediators do not literally make recommendation leading to war, but they may quit, and this usually results in con escalation by the contestants. 
18 

========19========

Pr[l; b; mi]. When player i is a hawk, she reports mi = h in equilibrium, and ex post 
individual rationality requires that 
bPr[b; h]  Pr[l; b; h]p + Pr[h; b; h]=2; for all b 2 (0;1); 
(1) 
which ensures that, if recommended the peaceful split b; i.e., for all b 2 (0;1) such that 
Pr[b; h] > 0; the hawk prefers accepting the split to starting a war. Similarly, when i is a 
dove, ex post individual rationality dictates that 
bPr[b; l]  Pr[h; b; l](1 
 p) + Pr[l; b; l]=2; for all b 2 (0;1): 
(2) 
Ex interim incentive compatibility requires that, when player i is a hawk, she truthfully 
reports mi = h: The associated constraint (ICH) dictates that

taking values l and h: Note that, as in 
the optimal separating equilibrium program, player i might behave opportunistically after 
deviating, as re by the maxima on the right-hand side. 
Similarly, to ensure truth-telling by player i when a dove, the following constraint (ICL) 
must be satis

19 

========20========

In the best equilibrium, the mediator seeks to minimize the probability of war, i.e., 
(1 
 q)2F(0jhh) + 2q(1 
 q)F(0jlh) + q2F(0jll): 
Because recommendations need to be self-enforcing, there is a priori no reason to restrict 
the mediator in the number of splits to which he assigns positive probability. In fact, rec- 
ommendations convey information about the most likely opponents’ revealed types, and it 
might be in the mediator’s best interest to scramble such information by means of multiple 
recommendations. Nevertheless, Proposition 3 below shows that relatively simple mech- 
anisms reach the maximal probability of peace among all possible mechanisms, including 
asymmetric ones. These simple mechanisms can be described as follows. Given reports 
(h; h), the mediator recommends the peaceful split (1=2;1=2) with probability qH, and 
war with probability 1 
 qH. Given reports (h; l), the mediator recommends the peaceful 
split (1=2;1=2) with probability qM, the split (b;1 
 b) with probability pM, and war with 
probability 1 
 pM 
 qM, for some b  1=2: Given reports (l; l), the mediator recommends 
the peaceful split (1=2;1=2) with probability qL, the splits (b;1 
 b) and (1 
 b; b) with 
probability pL each, and war with probability 1 
 2pL 
 qL. 
Again, we relegate the explicit formulas of the solution to the Appendix, and restrict 
ourselves here to the description of its main features. 
Proposition 3 A solution to the mediator’s problem is such that, for all  <  : 
 Doves do not  qL + 2pL = 1: 
 The low-type incentive compatibility constraint ICL binds, whereas the high-type in- 
centive compatibility constraint ICH does not, and b = p. 
 For   1 and  > = 2; hawk dyads  with positive probability, qH 2 (0;1), mixed 
dyads do not  (pM + 2qM = 1), and mediation strictly improves upon cheap talk. 
20 

========21========

 For   1 and   =2, the solution exactly reproduces the separating equilibrium 
of the cheap talk game (specially, qL = 1; qM = 0; pM 2 (0;1) and qH = 0), and 
mediation yields the same welfare as cheap talk. 
 For  < 1; the probability pL of unequal splits among dove dyads is bounded above 
zero, and mediation strictly improves upon cheap talk. 
We now comment on the solution and we make some comparisons with the optimal 
separating equilibrium characterized in Proposition 1. 
Suppose that  > 1. If  > = 2; then qM > 0: the mediator sometimes recommends 
the equal split (1=2;1=2) when one player reports to be a hawk, and the other claims to 
be a dove. In this way, the ex post IR constraint of the high type who is recommended 
the equal split becomes binding. We remark that this ex post constraint was slack in the 
unmediated equilibrium. By making a slack constraint binding, the mediator increases the 
probability of peace. Indeed, the mediator lowers the gain from pretending to be a hawk, 
by making exaggerating strength less pro against doves. When   =2 instead, 
qH = qM = 0 and the mediator does not improve upon unmediated communication. In this 
case, in fact, in both the mediated and the best (unmediated) separating equilibrium, war 
needs to occur with probability one in dyads of hawks, to avoid that doves misreport their 
type. But then the above-mentioned slack constraint is not relevant for either program, 
and the mediator cannot improve upon unmediated communication. 
In contrast with the case of   1, the mediator always yields a strict welfare im- 
provement when  < 1. When  > 1=(1 + ), so that b = p in the perfectly separating 
equilibrium, it is also the case that  > = 2 (note that 1=(1 + ) > =2), and hence the 
mediator helps for the same reasons as when   1. When  < 1=(1 + ), the mediator 
makes sure that the ICH constraint is satis with b = p. In fact, the mediator o 
(b;1 
 b) with positive probability when both players report to be doves. A hawk who is 
hiding strength, and who is o 1 
 b believes that the opponent is most likely a hawk, 
and does not wage war. This reduces the incentive to hide strength in order to wage war 
21 

========22========

if revealed that the opponent is weak, that we observed in the unmediated equilibrium. 
Hence, the expected payo of hiding strength is lower, and the ICH constraint is satis 
with b = p. Note that the ex post individual rationality constraint b  p was slack in the 
unmediated equilibrium. By making this rationality constraint binding, the mediator can 
improve the objective function, i.e. increase the probability of peace. 
We can now precisely answer the  set of questions presented in the introduction: 
 When does mediation improve on unmediated communication? 
{ When the intensity and/or cost of con is high (low ), mediation strictly 
improves the peace chance with respect to unmediated cheap-talk. 
{ When con is not expected to be very costly or intense (high ), mediation 
strictly improves the peace chance if and only if the proportion of hawks is 
intermediate, i.e., for high expected power asymmetry. 
 How does mediation improve on unmediated communication? 
{ When the proportion of hawks is intermediate (high expected power asymmetry), 
the mediator lowers the reward for a dove from mimicking a hawk, by not always 
giving the lion’s share to a declared hawk facing a dove (or, equivalently by not 
always revealing to a self-reported hawk that she is facing a dove). This lowers 
the incentive to exaggerate strength and achieves a favorable peace settlement 
with a dove. 
{ Instead, when the probability of facing a hawk is low and con is expected 
to be costly, the mediator’s strategy is to o with some probability unequal 
split to two parties reporting low type (or, equivalently the mediator does not 
always reveal to a dove that she is facing a dove). This lowers the incentive to 
hide strength and seek peace with a hawk. 
22 

========23========

Figure 3 shows the probability of peace in the mediated game compared to the proba- 
bility of peace induced by the best separating equilibrium. We note one sharp di 
between mediated and unmediated communication: the ex ante probability of peace is 
decreasing in , for  2 [=2; ), without mediation, whereas in the same range the ex 
ante probability of peace is increasing in  with mediation. This di could have an 
important impact on an important debate in international relations, namely the debate on 
\deterrence:" the higher is  (or q), the more \deterred" a country should be from initiating 
a war, due to a higher likelihood of facing a hawk. Hence, a possible interpretation of this 
di is that an international system with a level of deterrence higher than another is 
\good" for peace if every bilateral crisis is dealt with using mediators, whereas it is \bad" 
if direct communication is the most common way in which countries try to avoid wars. 
Figure 3: Probability of peace in the mediated vs. unmediated case, and region where mediation dominates 
We conclude by brie discussing the comparison between mediation and the best com- 
pletely mixed-strategy equilibrium. It should not be surprising to the reader familiar with 
the literature on correlated equilibrium (see, e.g. Aumann, 1974) that mediation strictly 
improves the chance of peace. By randomizing over recommendations, the mediator can 
23 

========24========

reproduce any distribution induced by mixing. In unmediated communication, however, 
because players must mix independently of each other, they cannot generate the optimal 
correlated distribution chosen by the mediator. The mixing by the dove may improve 
welfare upon the pure-strategy equilibrium, but at the cost of inducing war with positive 
probability within dove dyads. This does not occur with a mediator, who induces war only 
when at least one of the players is a hawk. 
5 The Role of Enforcement 
Even though the cause of war is asymmetric information, the analysis of the optimal 
mediation problem involves a signit enforcement problem. Countries are sovereign, and 
enforcement of contracts or agreements is often impossible. Because war can be started 
unilaterally, we have incorporated ex post IR and ex interim IC* constraints in the for- 
mulation of the optimal mediation program. In our model, the residual ex ante chance 
of war that results in the optimal mediation solution, can be thought as being due to a 
combination of asymmetric information and enforcement problems. 
So far, mediation has reduced to optimal information elicitation from, and transmission 
to, the con parties. One might also wonder whether the mediator could further 
reduce the ex ante probability of war if she were an arbitrator, i.e. if she were endowed 
with the power of enforcing agreements. For this, it is enough to compare our  
with those of Bester and Warneryd (2006). Rather than imposing ex post IR constraints 
and ex interim IC* constraints in our basic game of con they study the same set up 
with ex interim IR and IC constraints. Con parties must be willing to participate 
in the arbitration process, and to reveal their information to the arbitrator. But the 
arbitrator’s recommendations are enforceable by external actors, such as the international 
community. Hence, they abstract away from enforcement, and their model is suitable to 
describe arbitration. 
24 

========25========

Formally, invoking the version of the revelation principle proved by Myerson (1979), 
the Bester-Warneryd problem can be summarized as follows. The parties truthfully report 
their types L; H to the arbitrator. The arbitrator recommends peaceful settlement with 
probability p(m) after report m: Because recommendations are enforced by an external 
agency, they can restrict attention to a single peaceful recommendation x(m); for each 
report pair m:30 Symmetry is without loss of generality because the arbitrator’s program 
is linear, and entails that the settlement is (1=2;1=2) if the players report the same type, 
that the split is (b;1 
 b) if the reports are (h; l), and (1 
 b; b) if they are (l; h), for some 
b 2 [1=2;1]: Let pL = p(l; l); pM = p(l; h) = p(h; l) and pH = p(h; h). The arbitrator 
chooses b; pL; pM and pH so as to solve the program 
min (1b;pL;pM;pH

 pL) + 2q (1

30In fact, both participation and revelation decisions are taken 
before knowing the arbitrator’s recom- mendation, and hence the players’ payo depend only on the expected recommendation, and not on the realized one. Hence, as in footnote 24, any lottery over peaceful recommendations can be replaced without 
loss with its certainty equivalent.

In general, the solution of the program with an arbitrator (with enforcement power) pro- 
vides an upper bound to the solution of the program with a mediator (without enforcement 
power), as described in Section 4. Surprisingly, the solution of the latter program yields 
the same welfare as the solution of the former program.31 Speci, for   =2; the 
mechanisms with and without enforcement coincide. When  > = 2; the simplest optimal 
mechanism with enforcement is such that b < p, which is not self-enforcing. But the opti- 
mal mechanism without enforcement obfuscates the players’ reports, and this obfuscation 
succeeds in fully circumventing the enforcement problem. 
Proposition 4 An arbitrator who can enforce recommendation is exactly as ective in 
promoting peace as a mediator who can only propose self-enforcing agreements. 
The intuition is as follows. First, note that the dove’s IC constraint and hawk’s ex 
interim IR constraint are the only ones binding in the solution of the mediator’s program 
with enforcement power. Conversely, the only binding constraints in the mediator’s pro- 
gram with self-enforcing recommendations are the dove’s IC* constraint and the two ex 
post hawk’s IR constraints. Recall that, in our solution, the hawk is always indit 
between war and peace if recommended a settlement. Further, the dove’s IC* constraint in 
the mediator’s problem with self-enforcing recommendations is identical to the dove’s IC 
constraint in the arbitrator’s program, because a dove never wages war after exaggerating 
strength in the solution of mediator’s problem with self-enforcing recommendation. 
Further, the hawk’s ex interim IR constraint integrates the two binding hawk’s ex 
post IR constraints in the arbitrator’s problem. While requiring a constraint to hold in 
31This result facilitates the proof of Proposition 3. It is enough to establish that the simple mechanism characterized there, and described in closed form in the Appendix, satis the more stringent constraints of the mediator’s program. Because this mechanism achieves the same welfare as the solution to the arbitration problem, it must be optimal, a fortiori, in the mediator’s program. 
26 

========27========

expectation is generally a weaker requirement than having the two constraints, it turns out 
that the induced welfare is the same. This is easiest to see when   =2, as in this case the 
only settlement ever granted to a hawk is b; when the opponent is dove. For any mechanism 
with this property, the ex interim IR and the ex post IR constraints trivially coincide. Let 
us now consider the case  > = 2: In this case, the optimal truthful arbitration mechanism 
prescribes a settlement b < p that is not ex post IR for a hawk meeting a dove, as well as 
prescribing a settlement with slack, equal to 1=2; to same type dyads. The mediator cannot 
reproduce this mechanism. But it circumvents the problem with the obfuscation strategy 
whereby the hawk is made exactly indit between war and peace when recommended 
either the split 1=2 or the split b = p. Hence, it optimally rebalances the ex post IR 
constraints so as to achieve the same welfare as the arbitrator. 
We can now answer the last question that we posed in the introduction. 
 How do mediation and arbitration di in terms of con resolution? 
{ In our game, there is no di in terms of optimal ex ante probability of 
peace between the two institutions. 
{ Either the two optimal mechanism coincide, for  low relative to ; or the medi- 
ator’s optimal obfuscation strategy circumvents her lack of enforcement power. 
As striking as the results in this section might sound, we do not want to rule out the 
possibility that they rely on our discrete type space assumption. It would be interesting to 
examine when it extends to richer environments32 
6 Concluding Remarks 
By applying mechanism design techniques to the study of international con reso- 
lution, this paper derives a number of lessons on mediation, arbitration and unmediated 
32Indeed, it is known since at least Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) that such possibility results might hinge on discreteness.

communication. First, we have determined when mediation improves upon unmediated 
communication. This is the case when the intensity of con and/or cost of war is high 
(low ); when power asymmetry has little impact on the probability of winning; and even 
when neither  nor p is low, mediation can still be strictly better than direct communica- 
tion when the ex ante chance of power asymmetry is high (intermediate q). Second, we 
have characterized how mediation improves upon unmediated communication. In intuitive 
terms, this is achieved by not reporting to a player with probability one that her opponent 
is weak. In particular, when the ex ante chance of power asymmetry is high, the mediator 
lowers the reward from mimicking a hawk by not always giving the lion’s share to a hawk 
facing a dove. When the expected intensity or cost of con are high, regardless of the 
expected degree of uncertainty, the mediator reduces the temptation to hide strength by a 
strong player. The mediator’s strategy is to lower the reward from mimicking a dove by 
giving sometimes an unequal split to two parties reporting being a low type. Third, we 
have shown that the value of deterrence may depend on the con resolution institution. 
For intermediate probability that the players are strong, the probability of peace increases 
in the level of militarization when crises are mediated, whereas it decreases when peace 
talk are unmediated. Finally, we have shown that an arbitrator who can enforce outcomes 
is exactly as ee as a mediator who can only propose self-enforcing agreements. 
We conclude the paper by discussing a few matters that arise from our analysis. 
First, we address the question of whether disputants would consent to the involvement 
of a mediator in the peace talks. Speci, suppose that we augment our mediation 
game to include a stage in which, immediately after being informed of their types, the 
contestants simultaneously and independently choose whether to accept the mediator or 
resort to unmediated cheap talk. Further assume that mediation will take place if and 
only if both players agree. It can be shown that this game admits both equilibria in which 
mediation always takes place and ones in which it never occurs (details available upon

request). Hence, the optimal equilibrium of this game is, again, the one with mediation.33 
Second, we note that, while we have required recommendations to be self-enforcing, they 
need not be renegotiation-proof, as they might be Pareto-dominated for the players. For 
instance, when there is common belief that both players are hawks, they would be better o 
settling for an equal split rather than going to war, although doing so is part of the solution. 
Yet renegotiation-proofness does not seem to be a  and foremost concern of real world 
mediators. It is not overly realistic to think that, after the mediator quits, contestants 
who struggled to  an agreement in the presence of the mediator, will autonomously sit 
down at the negotiation table again, in search for a Pareto improving agreement. Indeed, 
while the literature on the causes of con underlines that contestants may not be able 
to individually commit to peaceful con resolutions, it may well be the case that they 
can jointly or even individually commit to belligerent resolutions, when such commitments 
are ex ante valuable. Audience costs, for instance, are recognized to provide an important 
channel that makes war threats credible (see, for instance, Tomz, 2007). 
Finally, we revisit the issue of commitment by the mediator. Our analysis suggests 
that the mediator’s success relies on her commitment to quit in some circumstances, rather 
than seeking a peaceful agreement in all contingencies. As stressed by Watkins (1998), this 
may be achieved by means of so-called action-forcing events. Further, before starting the 
mediation process, mediators often make clear to the disputants under which circumstances 
they will quit. Such contingent plan of actions often include deadlines. According to Avi 
Gil, one of the key architects of the Oslo peace process, \A deadline is a great but risky tool. 
Great because without a deadline it’s di to end negotiations. [The parties] tend to 
play more and more, because they have time. Risky because if you do not meet the deadline, 
either the process breaks down, or deadlines lose their meaning" (Watkins, 1998). Among 
the many cases in which this technique was used, see for instance Curran and Sebenius 
33Interestingly, scholars seem to disagree on the likely motives for consenting to mediation. According to Princen (1992), such motives are individual interests, rather than \shared values". But Bercovitch (1992, 1997) argues that disputants might view mediation as an expression of their commitment to peaceful con resolution, and seek it out of a desire to improve their relationships with each other.

Northern Ireland negotiations. Committing to such deadlines might be somewhat easier for 
professional mediators whose reputation is at stake, but they have been also used both by 
uno and o individuals, including Pope John Paul II and former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter.34 
Meanwhile, institutions like the United Nations increasingly sets time 
limits to their involvement upfront (see, for instance, the U.N. General Assembly report, 
2000).

Appendix A - Unmediated Communication 
Proof of Proposition 1 All the statements in the proposition, but the comparison with no-communication, follow from the following characterization lemma: 
Lemma 1 The best separating equilibrium is characterized as follows.

and V = 1 
 
 (1 + )(1 + )2: 
(c) When  2 [1=(1 + ); ); only the ICL constraint binds, 
b = p; pM = 1; pH =

(2 + ); 
and V = 
2(1 + ) +  
2 +  + (2 + ): 
2. Suppose that  > 1. 
(a) When  < = 2; only the ICL constraint binds,

(1 +

(b) When  2 [=2; ), only the ICL constraint binds, 
b = p; pM = 1; pH = 
2   
( + 2); 
and V = 1 
 
 (2 + )(1 + ): 
The proof of lemma 1 proceeds in two parts. Part 1 (  1): 
We set up the following relaxed problem: 
min (1b;pL;pM;pH 
 q)2(1 
 pL) + 2q(1 
 q)(1 
 pM) + q2(1 
 pH) 
subject to the high-type ex post IR constraints: 
b  p 
35 

========36========

to the probability constraints: 
pL  1; pM  1;0  pH 
and ex ante low-type IC* constraint: 
(1 
(  q) (1 
(  q) (1 
)  pL)2 + p 
1L 
2 
+ q ((1 
) ( 
(1 
 pM)2 + pMb 
+ q 
 pM)(1  p) + pM(1  b))  
) (1  pH)(1  p) + p 
1H 
2 
Step 1. We want to show that pL = 1: We  note that setting pL = 1 maximizes the LHS of the relaxed low-type IC* constraint and does not a the RHS. It is immediate to see that the high-type ex post constraint is not a either. 
Step 2. We want to show that the relaxed low-type IC* constraint binds. Suppose it does not. It is possible to increase pH thus decreasing the objective function without violating the constraint (note that there is no constraint that pH < 1 in the relaxed problem). 
 b appears in the LHS 
Step 3. We want to show that the high-type ex post constraint binds. Suppose it does not. Then b > p; and it is possible to reduce b without violating the ex post constraint. But this makes the low-type relaxed IC* constraint slack, because 
and b in the RHS. Because step 2 concluded that the low-type relaxed IC* constraint cannot be slack in the solution, we have proved that the ex post constraint cannot be slack.

in the relaxed 
Step 4. We want to show that for   =2: pH = 0; pM =

program. The low-type relaxed IC* constraint and ex post constraint de the function 
pM = 
(1 
( 
 H( + 2)); 
 2 + 1) 
(5) 
substituting this function into the objective function 
W = 2(1 
 q)(1 
 pM) + q(1 
 pH) 
duly simpli in light of step 1, we obtain the following expression: 
W = pH( 
2  2 + 1) ( + 1) 
+ 
 
( 
(2 +  + 3) 
 3 +   22  2 + 1) ( + 1) 
; 
36 

========37========

where we note that, because   2 the coet of pH is positive and the whole expres- sion is positive. Hence, minimization of W requires minimization pH: Setting pH = 0 and 
solving for pM in (5) yields 
pM = 
1 +  
1 
 2: 
Because   =2; it follows that pM  1, as required. We note that the probability of war 
equals: 
C = 
(2 
( 
 3 +   2 + 1) ( + 1)2 
 22): 
 
Step 5. We want to show that for   =2, pM = 1; pH = 
2  
(+2) 
in the relaxed problem. In light of the previous step, the solution pH = 0 yields pM > 1 and is not admissible when  > = 2. Because pM decrease in pH in (5), the solution requires setting pM = 1 and, from (5), pH = 
2  
(+2). When 
  =2; pH  0 and hence the solution is admissible. We note 
 
that the probability of war equals: 
C = 
( + 2) ( + 1): 
straints. The low-type ex post constraint 1 Because b > =2 and 1=2 > (1 
 
 p) is trivially satis when b = p. 
 b = 1 
 p  =2 yields 
2 1 
Step 6. We want to show that the solution constructed satis all the program con- 
 b  (1 
 p), the low-type ex ante IC* constraint coincides with the low-type ex ante relaxed IC* constraint. The condition 1 
 1, i.e.  = 
2p 1 
1  
 1. Hence, for   1, we conclude that  b  =2. So, after simpli the ex ante high-type IC* constraint becomes: 
 2p  , i.e. 1 
   2p 
= (1 
1H 
) 
 pH)2 + p 
(2  pM)p + pMb) + q

(1 
( 
(1

)  pH)2 + p 
2 
 
)  pM)2 + p 
M 
2 
which is satis (with slack when   =2). The probability constraints are obviously 
satis 
Part 2 (  < 1). We allow for two cases: 
37 

========38========

Case 1. I will temporarily consider the following relaxed problem: 
min (1b;pL;pM;pH 
 q)2(1 
 pL) + 2q(1 
 q)(1 
 pM) + q2(1 
 pH) 
subject to the low-type and high-type relaxed IC* constraints: 
(1 
(  q) (1

) (1  pH)(1  p) + p

) (1  pH)2 + p

) 
 b) : 
which embed the assumption (to be veri ex post) that 1 
constraints: 
pL  1; pM  1;0  pH 
 b  =2; and to the probability 
Step 1. As in the previous case, we conclude that pL = 1. 
Step 2. We want to show that the low-type relaxed IC* constraint binds. Indeed, if it does not, we can increase pH without violating neither relaxed IC* constraints (note that the LHS of the high-type relaxed IC* constraint increases in pH). 
Step 3. We want to show that the high-type relaxed IC* constraint binds. Suppose not. We can then reduce b because the LHS of the high-type relaxed IC* constraint increases in b and the RHS decreases in b. This makes the low-type relaxed IC* constraint slack, without changing pM and pH. But in light of step 2, this cannot minimize the objective function. Hence, the high-type relaxed IC* constraint must bind.

Step 4. We want to show that for  < = (1 + ), pH = 0 and pM = 
(1+)(1 ) 
solve the relaxed problem. The binding relaxed ex ante IC* constraints de the function:

b =

 2pH

pM =

Substituting pM into the objective function

W = pH1

      2 
( + 1) ( + 1) (1

because the coet of pH is positive, this quantity is minimized by setting pH = 0. Then, solving for pM and b when pH = 0 we obtain: 
b =

2 + 2 
(  2 pM =

we know that 1     so pM  0; but the condition pM  1 yields

C =

solve the original problem. Again, the low-type ex ante IC* constraint coincides with the relaxed low-type ex ante IC* constraint. We need to show that the ex post constraint b  p is satis In fact, simpli yields:

solves the relaxed problem. When  > = (1 + ), setting pH = 0 violates the constraint pM = 1: Further, the expression (6) reveals that pM decreases in pH. Hence minimization of pH; which induces minimization of W, requires setting pM = 1: Solving for 
b and pH, we obtain: 
b =

Step 7. We want to show that for  2 [=(1 + );minf1=(1 + ); g]; pM = 1; pH =

Finally we show that the high-type ex ante IC* constraint coincides with the (binding) relaxed high-type ex ante IC* constraint,

Case 2. We want to show that for  2 [1=(1 + ); ); pM = 1; pH =

(2+) 
solve the original problem. Consider now the same relaxed problem that we considered in the proof for the case of   1. We know from the analysis for the case   1, that this relaxed problem is solved by pH = 0; pM = 
1 
1+  2; b 
= p for  < = 2 and by pM = 1; pH = 2

(+2), with 
b = p. We now need to show that this is also the solution of the original problem. Again, the low-type ex ante IC* constraint coincides with the relaxed low-type ex ante IC* constraint. Consider the ex ante high-type IC* constraint. The condition 1  b = 1  p  =2 yields  = 
2p  1 
1   
 1. Hence, for   1, we conclude that 1  b  =2, and hence that 1  b  (1  p). So the ex ante high-type IC* constraint becomes:

a positive quantity as long as +  1, i.e.,  >

This concludes the proof of the characterization lemma. 
One can then verify by inspection that the above full characterization determines all the characteristics highlighted in Proposition 1, but the comparison with no communication, which we now determine.

Appendix B { Mediation 
For reasons of clarity, the proof of Proposition 3 is postponed to after the proof of 
Proposition 4 
Proof of Proposition 4. The proof follows from this Lemma. 
Lemma 3 The solution of the mediator’s program with enforcement power is such that:

pM =

Proof. We  solve the following relaxed program:

and to 
pL  1; pM  1 and pH  0: 
 pM)(1  p) + pM(1  b))  
) (1  pH)(1  p) + p 
1H 
2 
; 
First, note that pL = 1 in the solution because pL appears in the constraints only in the right-hand side of the low-type ex interim incentive compatibility constraint, which is increasing in pL. Second, note that the low-type ex interim incentive compatibility must be binding in the relaxed program’s solution, or else one could increase pH thus reducing the value of the objective function, without violating the high-typeex interim individual rationality constraint. Third, note that the high-type ex interim individual rationality constraint must be binding in the relaxed program’s solution, or else one could decrease b and make the low-type ex interim incentive compatibility slack. 
Solving for b and pH as a function of pM in the system de by the low-type ex interim incentive compatibility and high-type ex interim individual rationality constraints, and plugging back the resulting expressions in the objective function, we obtain 
C = 
 pM 
( + 1) ( + 1 
 + 1 
 ) 
+ K; 
where K is an inconsequential constant. Hence, the probability of con is minimized by setting pM = 1 whenever possible. Substituting pM = 1; in the expression for pH earlier 
 +1), which is strictly positive for 
  =2 and always smaller 
derived, we obtain pH = 
( than one.

Solving for b and pM as a function of pH in the system de by the low-type ex interim incentive compatibility and high-type ex interim individual rationality constraints, and plugging back the resulting expressions in the objective function, we obtain

 2 + 1) ( + 1)pH 
+ K;

where K is another inconsequential constant. The coet of pH is positive for   =2; hence the probability of con is minimized by setting pH = 0, which entails pM = 
 2+1; a quantity positive and smaller than one when   =2: 
The proof of Lemma 3 and hence of Proposition 4 is concluded by showing that this solution does not violate the high-type ex interim incentive compatibility and low-type ex interim individual rationality constraints in the complete program. 
Indeed, for   =2, we verify that the slacks of these constraints are, respectively

Lemma 4 A solution to the mediator’s problem is such that:

The ex ante peace probability is 
V = 
( 
 + 1   + 1) ( + 1): 
Proof. Consider the general mechanisms subject to the ex post IR and ex interim IC* constraints (1)-(4). It is straightforward to observe that the ex post IR constraints con- straints are stronger than the following (high-type and low-type, respectively) ex interim 
IR constraints 
∫ 
1 
bdF (bjh)  Pr[l; h]p + Pr[h; h]=2; 
∫0 
1 
bdF (bjl)  Pr[h; l](1 
0 
 p) + Pr[l; l]=2; for all b 2 [0;1] 
and that the ex interim IC* constraint are stronger than the ex interim IC constraint obtained by substituting the maxima with their  argument (the interim payo induced by accepting peace recommendations later in the game). 
By the revelation principle by Myerson (1979), the optimal ex ante probability of peace within the class of mechanisms which satisfy these ex interim IC and IR constraints cannot be larger than the ex ante probability of peace identi in Lemma 3 in Appendix D. Because the ex interim IC and IR constraints are weaker than the ex interim IC* and ex post IR constraints, it follows that any mechanism subject to the constraints (1){(4) cannot yield a higher ex ante probability of peace than the one identi in Lemma 3. 
Hence, to prove the result, it is enough to show that the formulas for the choice variables (b; pL; qL; pM; qM; qH) satisfy the constraints (1)-(4) and achieve the same ex ante probability of peace as in Lemma 3. Specialize to the mechanisms described by 
46

(b; pL; qL; pM; qM; qH), the ex post IR constraints take the following form, for the high type: 
bpM  pMp; (qqH + (1

 q)qMp; 
and for the low type: 
pLb  pL=2; (qpM + (1  q)pL)(1  b)  qpM(1  p) + (1 (qqM + (1  q)qL)  1=2  qqM(1  p) + (1  q)qL=2; 
 q)pL=2; 
whereas the high-type ex interim IC* constraint is 
q(qH=2 + (1  qH)=2) + (1  q)(pMb + qM=2 + (1  pM  qM)p)  maxf(qpM + (1  q)pL)(1  b); qpM=2 + (1  q)pLpg + maxf(1  q)pLb;(1 + maxf(qqM + (1  q)qL)  1=2; qqM=2 + (1  q)qLpg 
+q(1  pM  qM)=2 + (1  q)(1  2pL  qL)p; 
 q)pLpg 
and the low-type ex interim IC* constraint is 
q(pM(1  b) + qM=2 + (1  pM  qM)(1  p))

It is straightforward to verify that the values provided in Lemma 4 are such that the ex ante IC* constraint in which the low type does not wage war after misreporting is binding. Also, plugging in our two sets of values for the choice variables gives the same welfare as in Proposition 3. We are left with showing that all other constraints are satis We distinguish the two cases. 
Step 1. Suppose that  < = 2, so that qM = qH = 0: After simpli the low-type IC* constraint becomes 
q(pM(1  p) + (1 (1  q)pMp + q(1 
 pM)(1  p)) + (1  q)  1=2   p) + q(1  pM)=2;

which is binding for pM =

Consider the high-type IC* constraint 
q=2 + (1

Note that

Then we substitute in the high-type IC* constraint (duly simpli 
q=2 + (1

which is clearly satis because b = p. 
Similarly, we  that the two high-type ex post constraints 
pMb  pMp; and (qqH + (1

We need to show that the low-type ex post constraints are satis Indeed:

Proof of Lemma 2. We proceed in three parts. 
Part 1. (The low type mixes). 
The choice variables are b, , pL, pM, and pH. We have 19 constraints, i.e. one IC for the low type which is binding, four IC for the high type to get rid of the maximum in the constraint, two ex post constraints for high type, four ex post constraints for low type, and eight probability constraints. First we rearrange the IC constraint for low type and express b in terms of the other variables. Substituting b into objective function and constraints, we get rid of b and IC constraint for low type. After simplifying the constraints, we are left with the following constraints, referred to as constraints Ci, i = 1; : : : ;9. (We omit the constraints that all probabilities must be in [0;1].)

This section covers the case that only C5 binds. We do not assume C5 binds ex ante.

We set up the following relaxed problem: 
min 1pL;pM;pH; 
 ((

+ 2 
 1 +   pM 
1 +  1 +

subject to the following constraints: 
1. pL  1, 2. 0  pM  1, 3. pH  0, 4. 0    1, 
5. C5  0 , pL  (1 + (2 + )  )pH + (  2 + 2  1)pM.

 1 +  <  < 2. 
1. We want to show that pL = 1. Suppose pL < 1. We can set pL = 1 and 
increase pH to make sure C5 is satis By doing so, no constraint will be 
violated and the objective function is strictly decreased. 
2. We want to show that C5 binds. Suppose it does not. We can increase pH 
without violating other constraints and decrease the objective function. 3. Suppose (  2+2  1) > 0. Then

,H 
since (  2  1) < 0 and (1 + )  > 0. Therefore, we want pM to be as 
large as possible and pH to be as small as possible, i.e. pM = 1 or pH = 0. 
If     2 + 2  1, pH = 0 and pM = 
 
  2+2  1. 
If     2 + 2  1, pM = 1 and pH = 
1  +2   
1  +2+ 
. 
4. Suppose (  2 + 2  1)  0. We have pL + (   + 2  2 + 1)pM  
(1 + (2 + )  )pH. Then pL = 1, pM = 1 and pH = 
1  +2   
1  +2+. 
5. To sum up, we conclude that: 
(a) If 0    1 + 2  , then pL = 1, pM = 1, pH = 
1  +2   
1  +2+, and 
V = 
(1+  )2 
(1+)(1+(2+)  ). 
(b) If 1    1 + 2  , then pL = 1, pH = 0, pM = 
 
  2+2  1, and 
V =  
(1+  )((  1+  2)(1+)+(1+)). 
(1+)2(1  +2  2) 
Under the parameter region we specify above, we know that 1 + 2    1. 
Since   1, only case (a) is possible. And V is minimized when  = 1. 6. The solution to the relaxed problem is pL = 1, pM = 1, pH = 
2   
2+, 
 = 1, 
and V = 
 
2++2+ 
. Substituting these into the original problem, we can 
show that all the constraints are satis Therefore, this is also the solution 
to the original problem.

1. We want to show that pL = 1. Suppose not. We can increase pL and pH

can show that all the constraints are satis Therefore, this is also the 
solution to the original problem. 
 case 2: C1 binds 
This section covers the case that C1 binds and C5 might bind. We do not assume C1 binds ex ante.

========53========

We set up the following relaxed problem: 
min 1pL;pM;pH; 
 (( 
 
2pL

+ 2 
 1 +   pM 
1 +  1 +

subject to the following constraints: 
1. pL  1, 
2. 0  pM  1, 
3. pH  0, 
4. 0    1, 
5. C1  0 , pL  (1 + )(1 +

6. C5  0 , pL  (1 + (2 + )

{ Case 2.1: 
Parameter Region is 0<

and  <   
 
1 , or 
1=2<  
1 
2( 
1 + 
p5) and 
 
 
 <  < 
1  . 
 
1. We want to show that pL = 1. Suppose not. We can increase pL and pH 
and decrease the objective function without violating other constraints. 
2. It’s easy to show that either C1 or C5 binds. Suppose both are not bind- 
ing. We can increase pH without violating other constraints. Here, we  
consider the case where C1 binds. 
3. Suppose 2    1  0. Then 
MCpM 
= 
2    1 
< 
2 
MCpH 
= 
MUpM 
1+   1+   MUp 
. Therefore,H 
pM = 1 or pH = 0. If   (1 + )(  1   + 2), we have pM = 1 and 
pH = 
+(1+)(1+  2) 
(1+)(1+  ) 
 0. If   (1 + )(  1   + 2), we have pH = 0, 
pM = 
 
(1+)(  1  +2) 
 1. 
4. Suppose 2    1 < 0, we have pL = 1, pM = 1, and pH = 
+(1+)(1+  2) 
(1+)(1+  ) 
. 5. To sum up ,we can show that: 
(a) If 0    
(1+)(1+) 
1+2 
, then pL = 1, pM = 1 and pH = 
+(1+)(1+  2) 
(1+)(1+  ) 
. 
(b) If 1    
(1+)(1+) 
1+2 
, then pL = 1, pH = 0, and pM = 
 
(1+)(  1  +2). 6. Since in the parameter region speci above 
(1+)(1+) 
1+2 
 1, we know that 
only case (a) is possible. Hence, pL = 1, pM = 1, pH = 
+(1+)(1+  2) 
(1+)(1+  ) 
, 
and V = 
(1+  ) 
(1+)(1+)2 
. Notice that V is a quadratic function of  which is 
maximized at  =

7. Substituting pL, pM, and pL into C5, we have the following constraint on : 
(  1 
 2 +

√

Since 
1+ 
2 
< 1  1 < 2, we know that V is minimized at  = 1. 
8. Next we consider the case that C5 is binding. Using the same method, we 
get the minimized value which is larger than the V speci above. Hence, 
the solution to the relaxed problem is pL = 1, pM = 1, pH = 1  
 
+, 
 = 1, 
and V = 
 
(1+)(1+)2 
. Substituting the solution to the original problem, we 
show that all the constraints are satis Hence, this is also the solution 
to the original problem.

1. pL=1. Suppose not. We can increase pL and pH without violating other 
constraints. 
2. It is easy to show that either C1 or C5 binds. Suppose both are not bind- 
ing. We can increase pH without violating other constraints. Here, we  
consider the case where C1 binds. 
3. Suppose 2    1  0, 
MCpM 
= 
2    1 2 MUpM 
MCpH 1+

pM = 1 or pH = 0. If   (1 + )(  1   + 2), we have pM = 1 and 
pH = 
+(1+)(1+  2) 
(1+)(1+  ) 
 0. If   (1 + )(  1   + 2), we have pH = 0, 
pM =

4. Suppose 2    1 < 0, we have pL = 1, pM = 1, and pH = 
+(1+)(1+  2) 
(1+)(1+  ) 
. 
5. To sum up ,we can show that: 
(a) If 0

+(1+)(1+  2)

(b) If 1    
(1+)(1+) 
1+2 
, then pL = 1, pH = 0, and pM = 
 
(1+)(  1  +2). 
6. Since in the parameter region speci above

both case (a) and (b) are possible.

We can show that if  <

Here we rearrange the parameter region. We show that if 0    1
