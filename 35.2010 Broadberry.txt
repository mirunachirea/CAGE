Abstract: We provide annual estimates of GDP for England between 1270 and 1700 and  for  Great  Britain between  1700  and 1870,  constructed  from  the  output  side.  The  GDP  data  are  combined  with  population  estimates  to  calculate  GDP  per  capita.  We  find  English per capita income growth of 0.20 per cent per annum between 1270 and 1700,  although growth was episodic, with the strongest growth during the Black Death crisis of  the fourteenth century and in the second half of the seventeenth century. For the period  1700-1870, we find  British per  capita income  growth of 0.48 per  cent, broadly  in line  with the widely accepted Crafts/Harley estimates. This modest trend growth in per capita  income since 1270 suggests that, working back from the present, living standards in the  late medieval period were well above “bare bones subsistence”. This can be reconciled  with modest levels of kilocalorie consumption per head because of the very large share of  pastoral production in agriculture.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Two very contrasting view of the development of the British economy between the late  
medieval period and the Industrial Revolution co-exist. One view, which has been based  
largely on real wage evidence, paints a bleak picture of long run stagnation from the late  
thirteenth  century  to  the  middle  of  the  nineteenth  century,  albeit  with  quite  large  
fluctuations  over  sustained  periods  (Phelps  Brown  and  Hopkins,  1981).  This  view  has  
recently been supported by Clark (2005), who provides a real wage series which shows  
less extreme fluctuations than that of Phelps Brown and Hopkins, but leaves the trend  
unchanged. Furthermore, Clark (2007a) adds new time series for land rents and capital  
income  to  arrive  at  a  picture  of  long  run  stagnation  in  GDP  per  head.  This  view  sits  
uneasily with a second view, based largely on estimates of wealth and the appearance of  
new products, which  appears to show modest but sustained growth of living standards  
between  the  middle  ages  and  the  Industrial  Revolution  (Overton,  Whittle,  Dean  and  
Haan, 2004; de Vries, 1994). 
These  two  very  different  views  of  the  long  run  development  of  the  British  
economy have been able to co-exist because of the absence of reliable and empirically  
well  grounded  estimates  of  the  output  and  labour  productivity  of  the British  economy  
over much of this period. This paper forms part of a project to reconstruct the national  
income of Britain and Holland between the late thirteenth century and the late nineteenth  
century. Here, we present preliminary annual estimates of British GDP constructed from  
the output side. For the period before 1700, we work only with estimates for England, but  
2 

========3========

for the period 1700-1870 our estimates are for the territory of Great  Britain, including  
Wales and Scotland as well as England. 
For  agriculture,  we build  on  the path  breaking study  of  Overton  and  Campbell  
(1996), which tracked long run trends in agricultural output and labour productivity, but  
was restricted to estimates for a small number of benchmark  years. To  provide annual  
estimates, we rely heavily on three data sets assembled for the medieval, early modern  
and  modern  periods.  For  the  medieval  period,  we  analyse  the  Medieval  Accounts 
Database assembled by Campbell (2000; 2007), drawing upon the archival labours of a  
number of other historians, including David Farmer, John Langdon and Jan Titow. The  
information on arable yields and animal stocking densities is taken largely from manorial  
accounts, but is supplemented by information on the non-manorial sector from tithes. For  
the early modern period, we use the probate inventory database assembled by Overton,  
Whittle, Dean and Hann (2004), which provides indirect estimates of arable yields and  
animal stocking densities from the valuation of the assets left by farmers. From the early  
eighteenth  century  on,  we  make use  of  the  database  on  farm  accounts  assembled  by  
Turner, Beckett and Afton (2001). 
For industry and services, for the period after 1700 we build on the pioneering  
approach  of  Deane  and  Cole  (1967),  as  modified  by  Crafts  and  Harley  (1992). Gross  
output indicators  for  the  major  sectors  have  been  assembled  and  weighted  using  value  
added shares. For the period before 1700, a similar procedure has been used, drawing on  
as  many  sources  as  possible  for  the  output  indicators  and  assembling  new  sectoral  
3 

========4========

weights at the key benchmark years of 1377 and 1522, as well as the more familiar 1688  
benchmark based ultimately on the work of Gregory King [1696].  
For the period between 1270 and 1700, we find English per capita income growth  
of 0.20 per cent per annum on average. This cumulates to more than a doubling of per  
capita incomes, although growth was episodic rather than continuous, with the strongest  
growth  occurring  during  the  Black  Death  crisis  of  the  fourteenth  century  and  in  the  
second  half  of  the  seventeenth century.  For  the  period  1700-1870,  we  find  British per  
capita  income  growth  of  0.48 per  cent  per  annum,  broadly  in  line  with  the  widely  
accepted  Crafts/Harley  estimates.  This  cumulates  to  a  further doubling  of  per  capita  
incomes, and again growth was episodic, with periods of faster growth occurring 1780- 
1801 and 1830-1870. This modest trend growth in per capita income since 1270 suggests  
that,  working  back  from  the  present,  living  standards  in  the  late  medieval  period  were  
well  above  what  Allen  (2009:  36-41)  calls  “bare  bones  subsistence”.  This  can  be  
reconciled with modest levels of kilocalorie consumption per head because of the very  
large  share  of  pastoral  production  in  agriculture. This  meant  that  a  large  share  of  the  
English population were already in a position during the late Middle Ages to afford what  
Allen  calls  the  “respectable  lifestyle”,  with  a  more  varied  diet  including  meat,  dairy  
produce and ale, as well as the less highly processed grain products that comprised the  
bulk of the bare bones subsistence diet.  
Our estimates of GDP are built up primarily from the output side. However, the  
national  accounting  perspective  suggests  a  number  of  tests  which  can  be  conducted  to  
4 

========5========

demonstrate consistency, drawing on estimates from the income and expenditure sides. In  
particular,  we  check  consistency  with  the  real  wage  estimates  which  have  been  used  
frequently by economic  historians to draw conclusions about long run living standards  
(Clark,  2005;  Allen,  2001).  Second,  we  also  consider  per  capita  consumption  of  
kilocalories, to check the sustainability of the population (Overton and Campbell, 1996). 
The  paper  proceeds  as  follows.  Sections II  to  IV  describe  the  procedures  for  
estimating output  in  agriculture,  industry  and  services,  respectively.  Section  V then  
aggregates the sectoral outputs into real GDP for England during the period 1270-1700  
and Great Britain during 1700-1870, and combines these series with data on population to  
derive estimates of GDP per capita. In section VI, we compare the long run evolution of  
per capita GDP derived from the output side with real wages and examine the per capita  
consumption of kilocalories in the light of Allen‟s (2009) distinction between bare bones  
subsistence and respectable lifestyle baskets. Section VII places British economic growth  
in a wider international perspective, while section VIII concludes. 
II. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 
1. Arable farming in England, 1270-1870 
The starting point for any estimate of the output of the arable sector is the total area under  
crop, which is set out in Table 1. For most benchmark years, the data differ slightly from 
Overton and Campbell (1996), as a result of the incorporation of subsequent scholarship.  
Firm  estimates  of  land  use  only  became  available  in  the  agricultural  returns  of 1871,  
which therefore provides the starting point for the series. For 1830, the figures come from  
5 

========6========

the  tithe  files  and  for  1800,  1750  and  1700  from  estimates  by  contemporaries  
(Holderness,  1989). Here,  we  have  accepted  the  higher  figures  suggested  by  Prince‟s  
(1989:  41) interpretation  of  the  1801  Crop  Returns,  while  the  estimates  for  1600  have  
been  inferred  by  extrapolating  backwards  from  these  later  figures.  For  the  medieval  
period,  the  starting  point  is  the  estimate  for  1300.  Around  this  time,  the  population  
attained its medieval peak, so that the arable acreage would also have been at its peak.  
Contrary to the claims of Clark (2007b: 124), it is unlikely that the arable acreage in 1300  
could have been much above the level of 1800. Estimates for other years between 1270  
and 1500 are obtained by extrapolation from 1300 on the basis of trends in the cropped  
acreage on demesnes  and tithe data in the non-demesne sector (Campbell et al., 1996;  
Dodds, 2004; Medieval Accounts Database). 
Having obtained estimates of the overall arable acreage in use, the next step is to  
allocate it between fallow and the major crops sown. This information is taken from the  
Medieval  Accounts  Database for  the  period  before  1500,  the  Early  Modern  Probate  
Inventories Database for the period 1500-1750 and from Holderness (1989) and Overton  
(1996)  for  the  period  1750-1850. For  the  medieval  period,  it  should  be  noted  that  we  
assume the distribution of crops in the demesne sector to be representative of the country  
as a whole. This is broadly consistent with the much smaller amount of evidence on the  
non-demesne  sector  (Sapoznik,  2008;  Dodds,  2007). For  the  period  between  1492  and  
1553, there is a gap in information as the manorial records come to an end before the  
probate inventories become available.  
6 

========7========

The amount of fallow declined from between a third and a half in the medieval  
period to less than a quarter in the early modern period and to just 3.5 per cent by 1871.  
Information on the crop distribution is taken from data that are intrinsically local and of  
uneven  geographical  coverage,  so  that  a  system  of  regional  weightings  is  essential  to  
ensure a reliable national total. Each region‟s share of the national sown acreage is taken  
from the 1801 crop returns, but within each region, the breakdown of crops varies over  
time  in  line  with  the  information  in  the  databases. Amongst  the  principal  winter-sown  
crops, wheat remained important throughout the period, but rye and maslin (a mixture of  
wheat  and  rye) declined  sharply  during  the  modern  period. Amongst  the  spring-sown  
crops, barley and dredge (a mixture of barley and oats) remained important throughout  
the period, but oats declined in relative importance. The biggest increase in the use of  
arable land was in potatoes and other crops, particularly clover and root crops after 1700 
(Overton, 1996: 99-101, 110).  
To  calculate  output  from  the  estimated  areas sown  with  each  crop  requires  
information on grain yields per acre, net of seed sown. Weighted national average yields  
per  acre,  gross  of  tithe  and  seed  can  be  obtained  from  the  manorial  accounts  for  the  
medieval  period,  the  probate  inventories  for  the  early  modern  period  and  the  farm  
accounts  for  the  modern  period.  Each  dataset  has  been  divided  into  seven  regional  
groupings and separate chronologies have been constructed for each region before being  
combined into a single weighted master chronology for the country as a whole. Due to  
the  discontinuous  nature  of  much  of  the  data,  the  chronologies are  derived  using  
regression analysis with dummy variables for each farm and for each year, as suggested  
7 

========8========

by  Clark  (2004). Since  our  evidence  is  drawn  from  the  seigniorial  sector,  we  need  to  
consider what was happening in the non-demesne sector. Although Postan (1966) clearly  
believed that yields were higher on the demesnes as a result of access to better land and  
more capital, Stone (2006: 21) has recently argued that yields were around 11 per cent  
higher in the non-demesne sector, where incentives were stronger for peasants. Since the  
direction  of  the  adjustment  is  unclear,  and  would  anyway  be  quite  small,  we  have  
assumed that yields on the demesne sector were representative of English agriculture as a  
whole.  
Wheat yields gross of seed as well as tithe are shown in Figure 1 for wheat, for  
illustrative purposes. From these gross yields it is necessary to subtract grain used as seed 
to  derive  the  net  yields  shown  in  Table  2  for  all  the  major  crops.  There  are  some  
differences between crops, but the different datasets appear to tell a consistent story, with  
yields  declining  during  the  late  medieval  period  from  around  1300,  picking  up  again  
during  the  early  modern  period  from  the  mid-sixteenth  century,  and  growing  more  
rapidly during the modern period from the early eighteenth century. The data exhibit a  
high degree of short run volatility, which has been smoothed out in Figure 1 with a 10- 
year moving average. 
In  addition  to  making  allowance  for  grain  used  as  seed,  calculation  of  the  net  
output  of  the  arable  sector  must  take  account  of  consumption  of  oats  and  pulses  by  
animals working on the farm. For the medieval and early modern periods, estimates of  
the numbers of working animals per 100 sown acres can be obtained from the medieval  
8 

========9========

accounts  and probate inventory  databases. For the early modern period, these stocking  
densities  are assumed  to  apply  to  the  whole  agricultural  sector  and  hence  are  simply  
multiplied  with  the  sown  acreage  to  produce  estimates  of  the  numbers  of  working  
animals.  However,  for  the  medieval  period,  the  demesne  stocking  densities  have  been  
converted into the numbers of horses and oxen on all lands using Wrigley‟s (2006: 449)  
assumption that the stocking density of animals on non-seigniorial holdings was three- 
quarters that on the demesnes. In making these estimates, allowance has been made for  
both the declining share of demesne acreage and the lesser quantities of fodder consumed  
by immature animals. As with the crop yields, a regional weighting scheme is needed to  
derive  the  stocking  densities  for  the  country  as  a  whole  from  the  observations  on  
individual  demesnes  and  farms.  For  the  modern  period,  direct  estimates  of  animal  
numbers are taken from Mitchell (1988), Turner (1998) and Allen (2005), since data on  
stocking densities are unavailable. 
Figure 2 sets out the numbers of mature working animals in England. There was a  
gradual process of substitution of horses for oxen as working animals, beginning in the  
medieval period. By the nineteenth century, the use of oxen had more or less died out. 
Using  assumptions  about  consumption  of  oats  and  pulses  by  mature  and  immature  
animals, it is possible to derive estimates of farm animal consumption, which are then  
subtracted from gross output to derive arable output net of seed and animal consumption  
in Table 3. 
9 

========10========

During the medieval period, output of wheat and rye, the principal bread grains,  
declined substantially from the late thirteenth century peak, with a sharp fall in line with  
population following the Black Death of the mid-fourteenth century. The output decline  
was even sharper for oats, which fell out of favour as a crop for human consumption. In  
place of malted oats, malted dredge (a barley/oats mixture) and malted barley became the  
preferred brewing grains, and demand for barley remained relatively buoyant. Output of  
pulses also declined relatively slowly during the medieval period. 
By the end of the sixteenth century, output of the major grains was back to the  
peak pre-Black Death level. Output of wheat continued to increase after 1600, while rye  
declined. This reflected the growing preference for the more expensive bread grain. The  
output of barley increased markedly in line with the demand for better quality ale brewed  
from the best barley malt. Output of pulses also grew rapidly during the early modern  
period, while potatoes became an important crop during the eighteenth century. Output of  
oats, net of consumption by farm horses, fluctuated more erratically.  
2. Pastoral farming in England, 1270-1870 
The starting point for deriving the numbers of non-working animals is again the stocking  
densities. As with the working animals, particular care must be taken for the medieval  
period in moving from the stocking densities on the demesnes to the numbers of animals  
in  the  country  as  a  whole.  Conversion  of  the  seigniorial  stocking  densities  into 
corresponding  national  densities  and  numbers  of  animals  is  based  on  four  key  
assumptions. First, following Allen (2005), it has been assumed that due to their high unit  
10 

========11========

capital  value,  the  density  of  cattle  was  one-third  lower  on  the  non-demesne  lands.  
However, we have also made an allowance for the negative relationship between farm  
size and stocking density, drawn from the post-1550 data. Second, again following Allen  
(2005), mature cattle have been divided into milk and beef animals in the ratio 53 to 47 
percent. Third, swine, a popular animal with peasants, are assumed to have been stocked  
by non-seigniorial producers at the same density as on the demesnes.1 Fourth, aggregate  
sheep numbers are assumed to have been stationary in the long term, in contrast 
to their  
dynamic  growth  in  the  seigniorial  sector.  This  is  consistent  with  trends  in  exports,  
inferred levels of domestic demand, and the decline in average fleece weights noted by  
Stephenson (1988: 380). 
Stocking densities can also be obtained for the  
early modern period from probate  
inventories,  but  are  unavailable  for  the  modern  period.  For  1750  onwards,  animal  
numbers  are  taken  directly  from  conte 
mporary  estimates  from 
(1988) and Turner (1998),  
and interpolated using data on ann 
the Metropolitan Cattle Market  
from Mitchell (1988: 708) 
working animal numbers for the whole period  
10 -year moving averages to smooth out short run volatility

Note that if we were to adopt Wrigley‟s (2006) assumption that swine were stocked at twice the manorial  
density  by  peasants,  this  would  produce  an  implausibly  large  jump  in  swine  numbers  between  the  late  
medieval and early modern periods. 
11 

========12========

Calculating  the  output  of  the  pastoral  sector  is  more  speculative  than  the  
equivalent calculation for the arable sector, since the percentages of animals producing  
specific products and the yields per animal have attracted less attention from historians  
than  crop  yields.  Until  more  systematic  work  is  done  on  the  sources,  the  estimates  
advanced here are necessarily provisional.  
Table 4 sets out the numbers of non-working animals, with cattle divided between  
milk  and  beef  herds  and  calves.  The  proportions of  animals  assumed  to  have  been  
producing  milk,  meat and  wool  are  set  out  in  Table  5. A  high  proportion  of cows  are  
assumed  to  have  produced  milk  and a  high  proportion  of sheep  to  have  yielded  wool.  
Meat,  however,  was  produced  only  by  those  animals  that  were  slaughtered.  Following  
Holderness (1989: 147), it is assumed that approximately a quarter of the stock of cattle  
and sheep and around half of all pigs were slaughtered in the early modern period. These  
ratios  are  also  applied  to  the  late  medieval  period  for  sheep  and  pigs,  in  line  with  
slaughter rates documented by Campbell (1995: 164-167). For cattle, however, slaughter  
rates were lower in the medieval period because there were few herds kept specifically  
for beef. By 1850, however, cattle herds were increasingly being kept for the production  
of beef, so that slaughter rates increased. Similarly, for sheep there was a shift from wool  
to  mutton  production  in  the  modern  period,  simultaneously  raising  the  percentage  of  
animals producing mutton and reducing the percentage producing wool. For pigs, high  
slaughter  rates  of  100  per  cent  were  possible  because  of  the  large  number  of  piglets  
produced during the year. These basic assumptions have been qualified with additional  
information from Clark (1991) and Ecclestone (1996). 
12 

========13========

The next step in the calculations involves the estimation of yields of milk, meat  
and wool per animal. Table 6 sets out our preferred estimates, drawn from a number of  
sources,  including  Clark  (1991),  Allen  (2005),  Stephenson  (1988)  and  Britnell  (2004).  
Data between benchmark years were interpolated using information on the relative prices  
of  pastoral  products  and  the  animals  from  which  they  were  derived.  Finally,  Table  7 
combines the information on numbers of animals, percentages of each animal producing  
and yields per animal to provide estimates of output in the pastoral farming sector. 
Further  assumptions  are  needed  to  derive  output  estimates  for  hay,  hides  and  
skins, and dairy products. Hay output is derived from the numbers of non-farm horses, on  
the assumption that each horse consumed 2.4 tons of hay per year (Allen, 2005). Output  
of  hides  and  skins  is  derived  from  the  numbers  of  working  and  non-working  animals  
using  assumptions  on  the  percentages  of  each  animal  producing  and  yields  per  animal  
from Clark (1991), Clarkson (1989) and Ecclestone (1996). In the dairy sector, output is  
split  between  cheese,  butter  and  fresh  milk  using  data  from  Biddick  (1989)  and  
Holderness (1989). 
3. Total agricultural output in England, 1270-1870 
Multiplying the output volumes by their prices yields the total value of net output. The  
price  data  are  taken  largely  from  Clark  (2004),  who  synthesises  the  published  data  of  
Beveridge  (1939),  Thorold  Rogers  (1866-1902:  volumes  1-30)  and  the  multi-volume  
Agrarian History  of  England  and  Wales,  as  well  as  integrating  new  archival  material,  
13 

========14========

principally  from  the  unpublished  papers  of  William  Beveridge  and  David  Farmer.  To  
this, have been added the prices of hides from Thorold Rogers (1866-1902) and of rye  
from  Farmer (1988;  1991),  as well  as  direct  estimates  from the  Early  Modern  Probate  
Inventories Database. Output can be valued in both current prices and in constant 1700  
prices. 
Figure 4 plots arable, pastoral and total agricultural output in constant prices on a  
logarithmic scale, while Table 8 summarises the same information in growth rate form,  
using 10-year averages to capture long run trends. It should be noted that the gap between  
1492 and 1553 in the series for arable and pastoral production has been filled at the level  
of  total  agricultural  output  using  the  demand  function  approach  of  Crafts  (1985)  and  
Allen (2000). Agricultural consumption per head is assumed to be a function of its own  
price (PA), the general price level (PY) and income (Y). Income and price elasticities are  
estimated from the data for output (adjusted for net imports), prices and real wages over  
the period 1301-1492 and 1553-1700, and used to predict the missing values of output  
between 1492 and 1553, based upon the known values of prices and real wages for this  
period. The results are discussed in detail in Broadberry and van Leeuwen (2010a). 
During  the  medieval  period,  arable  output  exhibited  a  clear  downward  trend,  
while  pastoral  output  showed greater stability.  Agriculture  as  a  whole  thus  showed  a  
modest decline in output. From the mid-sixteenth century, arable and pastoral output both  
grew, with the pastoral sector at first lagging behind the arable sector, but outpacing it  
from the mid-seventeenth century. 
14 

========15========

The pastoral sector was thus increasing its share of real agricultural output during  
the  medieval  period  and  from  the mid-seventeenth  century.  However,  in  current  price  
terms the picture is complicated by changes in relative prices. In particular, although the  
price of pastoral products relative to arable products was fairly stable during the medieval  
period,  it  then  trended  downwards,  particularly  during  the  “Great  Inflation”  of  the  
sixteenth  century. This  amplified  the  effects  of  the  slower  real  growth  of  the  pastoral  
sector  between the  1450s  and  the  1650s,  and  then  dampened  the  effects  of  the  faster  
pastoral growth after 1650. Thus the current price data in Table 9 show the pastoral sector  
increasing its  share  of  output  during  the  medieval  period and  again  from  the  mid- 
seventeenth century. Between the mid-fifteenth century and the mid-seventeenth century,  
by contrast, the share of the pastoral sector in current price agricultural output declined.  
However, what is perhaps most striking about  Table 9 is the already very high  
share of the pastoral sector in medieval England. This meant that although the English  
people did not have a particularly generous diet if viewed in terms of kilocalories, it was  
a varied diet, with meat, dairy produce and ale to supplement the less highly processed  
grain products that made up the bulk of the diet. 
III. INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION 
1. Industrial output in England, 1270-1700 
For the period 1270-1700, it is possible to obtain volume measures of some of the key  
industries, which  can  be  broken  down  into  three  major  sectors:  metals  and  mining;  
15 

========16========

textiles  and  leather;  and  other industries. The  metals  and  mining  sector  is  based  on  
physical output volumes for a number of important industries. Tin output is available on  
an annual basis for the whole period from 1301 with relatively few gaps, from Hatcher  
(1973:  156-159)  and  Mitchell  (1988:  303-304). King  (2005)  provides  data  on  bar  iron  
production for the period 1490-1700. The output of coal in the 1560s and circa 1700 is  
taken from Hatcher (1993: 68), interpolated using shipments of coal from north-eastern  
ports, also taken from Hatcher (1993: 487-495), updating the earlier work of Nef (1932:  
380-381). 
The  textiles  and  leather  sector  is  based  on  volume  indicators  of  the  key  raw  
material inputs of wool and animal hides. Exports of wool and woollen cloth are given by  
Carus-Wilson  and  Coleman  (1963)  for  the  period  1280-1554.  However,  the  export  of  
wool is negatively related to the export of cloth, so we use the production of wool from  
agriculture minus wool exports as an indicator of the woollen textile industry. The output  
of hides from pastoral agriculture is used to track the output of the leather industry. 
Food  processing,  building  and  book  production  are  grouped  together  as  the  
relatively heterogeneous group of other industries. Food processing is assumed to grow in  
line with agricultural output. Building is assumed to  grow in line with population, but  
with  an  allowance  for  urbanisation. For  the  medieval  period,  however,  allowance  has  
been made for church building, using data on the number of cathedral and abbey building  
projects derived from Morris (1979: 179). Book production is measured by the index of  
16 

========17========

new  English  language  book  titles  obtained  from  the  English  Short  Title  Catalogue 
(http://estc.bl.uk/F/?func=file&file_name=login-bl-list). 
We provide an index of industrial production using the weighting scheme shown  
in Table 10. The weights for circa 1700 are derived from Hoffmann (1955), but with a  
number of modifications, including an allowance for the production of books as well as  
the reworking of the weighting scheme by Crafts et al. (1989). Figure 5 plots the index of  
industrial production on a logarithmic scale, using a 10-year moving average to remove  
excessive short run volatility. Table 11 summarises the same information in growth rate  
form over fifty year periods, using 10-year averages to capture long run trends. Following 
a period of stagnation in industrial output as population declined after the Black Death,  
there  was  a  return  to industrial growth after  1500,  which  can be  discerned clearly in  
Figure 5.  
2. Industrial output in Great Britain, 1700-1870 
Industry  is  the  one  sector  for  which  data  have  previously  been analysed at  annual  
frequency during the period 1700-1870, building on the pioneering work of Hoffmann  
(1955).  However,  as  Crafts  (1985)  and  Harley  (1982)  pointed  out  independently,  
Hoffmann (1955) inadvertently overstated the growth rate of industrial output during the  
Industrial Revolution as a result of his weighting procedures. The problem is that a few  
industrial branches, most notably cotton and iron, grew much more rapidly than the rest  
of  industry,  and  these  branches  are  included  in  Hoffmann‟s  data  set.  However,  the  
available time series cover only 56 per cent of industrial output, and the weights of these  
17 

========18========

industries  are  increased  proportionally  to  achieve  100  per  cent  coverage  of  industrial  
output. But this means that the unrepresentative, rapidly growing branches of cotton and  
iron  effectively  have  their  weights  doubled.  Harley  (1982)  and  Crafts  et  al. (1989)  
propose that only the weights of industries other than cotton and iron should be increased  
to arrive at 100 per cent coverage. 
In  addition  to  changing  the  weighting  scheme,  Harley  (1982)  and  Crafts et  al. 
(1989) also replaced some of the older series used by Hoffmann (1955), drawing on the  
latest  scholarship.  We  use  these  series,  together  with  some  later  additions,  the  most  
important of which are the new series of bar iron output from King (2005), Feinstein‟s  
(1988: 446) series of investment in total buildings and works for output of the building  
industry,  and  an  index  of  new  English  language  book  titles  derived  from  the  English  
Short Title Catalogue and the British Library for the output of the printing industry.  
Figure 6 presents our series for industrial output, together with the “revised best  
guess”  series  of  Crafts  and  Harley  (1992)  and  Hoffmann‟s  (1955)  original  index  for  
contrast.  The  biggest  difference  is  between  the  Hoffmann  index  and  the  other  two  
indices, as a result of the excessive weight given to cotton textiles and iron in the former.  
Our  series  shows  slightly  slower  growth  than  the  Crafts-Harley  index  during  the  early  
eighteenth century, largely as a result of the inclusion of new series, particularly King‟s  
(2005) data for the iron industry. From the mid-eighteenth century onwards, differences  
between the two series are relatively minor, and essentially confirm the picture originally  
presented in Crafts et al. (1989). Output growth accelerated from around 1740 to 1840  
18 

========19========

before  tapering  off.  Again,  there  is  quite  a  substantial  cyclical  dimension  to  industrial  
output.  Table  12  presents  the  annual  growth  rates  of  industrial  output  over  the  
conventional sub-periods calculated using both the raw annual data and 10-year averages,  
together with the Crafts-Harley estimates for comparison. 
IV. SERVICES 
1. Services in England, 1270-1700 
The  service  sector  has  received  much  less  attention  from  economic  historians  than  
agriculture and industry. Here, we build on the approach used by Deane and Cole (1967)  
to estimate service sector output in eighteenth century Britain. For England 1270-1700,  
we break down services into government, commerce, and housing and domestic service.  
For government,  we  use  a 10-year  moving  average of  real  government  revenue  from  
O‟Brien  and  Hunt  (1999),  which  is  available  for  the  whole  period  from  the  European  
State  Finance  Database  at 
http://www.le.ac.uk/hi/bon/ESFDB/frameset.html.  For  
commerce, we combine indicators of international trade and transport, domestic trade and  
transport and finance, while housing and domestic service are assumed to grow in line  
with population. International trade and transport is measured by data on wool exports,  
the distances shipped and the growth of the English shipping tonnage, from Carus-Wilson  
and  Coleman  (1963),  Fisher  (1940;  1950) and  Davis  (1954;  1962),  with  log-linear  
interpolation for missing years. Domestic trade and transport is measured by an index of  
marketed agricultural and industrial output. Changes in the share of output marketed are  
captured by the cumulative number of new markets established in the period 1300-1490  
and the urban share of the population from 1490 to 1700. The data on the growth of the  
19 

========20========

market are taken from Letters (2005). Financial intermediation is measured by the inverse  
of  the  velocity  of  circulation,  derived  from  Mayhew  (2009),  building  on  Cameron‟s  
(1967)  finding  of  a  declining  velocity  over  the  long  run.  The  inverse  of  velocity  is  
interacted  with  population  as  a  scaling  factor  to  derive  an  index  of  financial  sector  
activity. 
The weights for the main service sectors are shown in Table 13, and are derived 
from  the circa  1700 shares  in  Crafts  (1985:  16).  The  resulting  series  for  total  service  
sector output is plotted in Figure 7, and the growth rates for the whole period and sub- 
periods are presented in Table 14. Total service sector output trended downwards during  
the medieval period, before picking up strongly after 1500. 
2. Services in Great Britain, 1700-1870 
For Great Britain, 1700-1870, we again follow the approach of Deane and Cole (1967),  
who  provided  estimates  for  benchmark  years.  Here,  however,  we  provide  data  at  an  
annual frequency. Also, we take account of the downwards revision by Crafts (1985) of  
Deane and Cole‟s estimates of service sector growth, particularly for the early nineteenth  
century.  For  the  eighteenth  century  Deane  and  Cole  (1967:  76-78)  assumed  that  
“commerce”  grew  at  the  same  rate  as  industry,  that  “rent  and  miscellaneous  services”  
increased in line with population, and that “government and defence” could be measured  
by real public expenditure. Crafts (1985: 35-37) made only minor changes here. For the  
nineteenth century, however, Deane and Cole (1967: 166) derived estimates of income in  
“trade  and  transport”,  “domestic  and  personal”,  “housing”,  “government,  professional  
20 

========21========

and other services” and deflated them by the Rousseaux price index. Crafts (1985: 31)  
showed that this produces an implausibly high rate of growth for commerce, and assumed  
instead that commerce grew in line with national income, thus introducing an element of  
iteration into the estimates. Crafts (1985: 35-37) used employment growth for domestic  
and personal services and new estimates of the housing stock for housing. He also revised  
the growth rate of government using new data on employment growth. 
Our estimates are broadly consistent with those of Crafts (1985), but make a few  
changes  to  reflect  the  need  for  annual  data.  The  most  important  difference  is  in  
commerce,  where  we  measure  the  growth  of  output  using  volume  series  covering  
transport, finance and other commerce. This produces results which are not far out of line 
with the Deane and Cole (1967) assumption for the eighteenth century, that commerce  
grew  in  line  with  industry.  This  also  avoids  the  iterative  element  in  the  Crafts  (1985)  
assumption  that  commerce  grew  in  line  with  national  income  during  1801-30,  and  
ensures consistency of treatment throughout the whole period.  
For government, we use civil government and defence expenditure throughout the  
whole period, deflated using the Schumpeter-Gilboy and Rousseaux price indices from  
Mitchell (1988: 719-723). For housing,  we use the stock  estimates of Feinstein (1988: 
389), using a regression relationship between housing stock and population to fill in gaps.  
Output  of  domestic  and  personal  services  is  assumed  to  rise  in  line  with  the  urban  
population,  as  during  the  pre-1700  period.  This  inevitably  produces  a  relatively  stable  
21 

========22========

path  for  output  in  domestic  and  personal  services,  which  is  consistent  with  most  
assessments of this sector. 
Our annual index of service sector output is plotted in Figure 8. The trend pattern  
is  of  an  increase  in  the  growth  rate  from  around  1780.  Table  15  presents  the  annual  
growth rates of services output over the conventional sub-periods calculated using both  
the raw annual data and 10-year averages, together with the Crafts-Harley estimates for  
comparison. Our estimates are clearly very similar to those of Crafts and Harley (1992). 
V. REAL GDP, POPULATION AND GDP PER CAPITA 
1. Real GDP and GDP per capita in England, 1270-1700 
The next step is to construct an index of real GDP for England over the period 1270-1700  
from the above output series for agriculture, industry and services, using an appropriate  
set of weights. Table 16 sets out the weighting scheme, derived from reconstruction of  
nominal GDP by sector. Real output trends from the sectoral series described earlier in  
the  paper are  transformed  into  current  price  trends  using  sectoral  price  deflators,  with  
absolute levels of GDP in current prices established using an input-output table for 1841. 
For the period 1270-1450, we use 1381 weights, a year for which it is also possible to  
establish  sectoral  labour  force  shares  from  the  Poll  Tax  Returns.  For  the  period 1450- 
1550, we use 1522 weights, matching labour force shares derived from the Muster Rolls.  
For 1550-1650, we use 1600 weights. Finally, for 1650-1700, we use circa 1700 weights,  
matching  the  labour  force  estimates  derived  from  the  original  study  by  Gregory  King  
[1696]. The resulting series, plotted in Figure 9, can be used to  calculate  growth  rates  
22 

========23========

over 50-year periods, presented in Table 17. English GDP trended down after the Black  
Death, before returning to positive growth from the late fifteenth century. Over the whole  
period  1270-1700,  the  English economy  averaged  a  growth  rate of 0.24 per  cent  per  
annum. 
Ultimately,  we  are  interested  in  what  happened  to  GDP  per  capita,  the  most  
widely  accepted  indicator  of  material  living  standards  over  the  long  run.  Although  the  
population of England has been firmly  reconstructed by Wrigley  and Schofield (1989)  
and  Wrigley et  al. (1997)  for  the  period  since  the  compulsory  registration  of  births,  
marriages and deaths, estimates before 1541 are  more speculative. For the period after  
1541,  the  data  in  Table  18 are  based  on  the  estimates  of  Wrigley  et  al. (1997),  
interpolated  using  Wrigley  and  Schofield  (1989).  For  earlier  years,  our  estimates  are  
based on data for individual parishes, extending forwards in time the approach of Hallam  
(1988). It should be noted that our peak medieval population estimate of 4.81 million in  
1348 is a  little  higher  than the  range  of  4.0  to  4.5  million suggested  by  Overton  and  
Campbell (1996), but still well below the figure of at least 6 million suggested by Postan  
(1966)  and  Smith  (1991). As  Overton  and  Campbell  (1996)  point  out,  such  a  high  
population  estimate  has implications  for  other  variables  such  as  land  use,  crop  
combinations,  yields  and  kilocalorie  extraction  rates  and  the  share  of  the  population  
living in towns, which would be hard to square with other evidence. We shall return to  
this  issue  in  the  section  on  consumption. Note  the impact  of  the Black  Death,  which  
struck in 1348-49, leading to an immediate sharp collapse in the population, followed by  
a further decline which continued until the mid-fifteenth century.  
23 

========24========

Combining the population data with the real GDP series produces our estimates of  
GDP per capita growth in Table 19. The trend is of modest positive per capita income  
growth between 1270 and1700, at an average annual rate of 0.20 per cent. However, the  
path of growth was episodic. We find that GDP per capita grew substantially during the  
Black  Death  crisis  of  the  fourteenth  century, and  then remained  on  a  plateau between  
circa 1450 and 1650 before resuming growth during the second half of the seventeenth  
century. These trends can also be seen in Figure 10, which plots GDP per capita on a  
logarithmic scale. Note that although there were some isolated bad years between 1550  
and 1650, the trend level of per capita income remained above the level of the pre-Black  
Death period. 
Per  capita  income  growth  before  the  Industrial  Revolution  thus  appears  to  be  
confined largely to periods of falling population. This may at first sight appear to confirm 
the  Malthusian  interpretation  of  writers  such  as  Postan (1972)  and  Clark (2007a). The  
Malthusian model depends on two key assumptions. First, population responds positively  
to real incomes, so that if real income falls, fertility declines (the preventive check) and  
mortality increases (the positive check). Second, there is a negative relationship between  
the population level and real income, because of diminishing returns to labour, holding  
land  fixed. However, it  is  helpful  to  follow  Mokyr  and  Voth  (2010)  in  distinguishing  
between the strong and weak versions of the Malthusian model. In the strong version, the  
iron  law of  wages  holds,  so  that  if  there  is  a  positive  shock  to  real  incomes,  they  are  
quickly forced back down to “bare bones” subsistence. In the weaker version, the positive  
24 

========25========

and preventive checks operate, but not sufficiently strongly to bring the economy back to  
bare bones subsistence. In the weaker version of the Malthusian model, a society may  
have a per capita income level sufficient for the majority of the population to afford the  
respectability  basket,  as  a  result,  for  example,  of  restrictions  on  fertility through  late  
marriage.  
The evidence for pre-industrial England presented above is clearly not consistent  
with the strong version of the Malthusian model offered by Postan (1972). First, although  
population was above the medieval peak by 1700, per capita incomes were around twice  
as high. The economy was able to support a larger population with a smaller proportion 
working  in  agriculture, freeing  up  others to  produce  the  industrial  goods  and  services  
demanded  in  a  more urbanised society.  Second, although it  is  not  known  when  it  first  
became the norm, late marriage is known to have been prevalent in early modern England  
(Wrigley  and  Schofield,  1989;  Wrigley et  al.,  1997).  Third,  fertility  limitation  and the  
high  share  of  the  pastoral  sector  meant  that  living  standards  for  the  majority  were  
“respectable” in 1300, and remained so throughout the period. Nevertheless, it must be 
emphasised that  there  was  a  sizeable  minority  of people  at  the  bottom  of  the  income  
distribution who were living at bare bones subsistence. Allen (2009: 50) suggests that this  
group  represented  18.3  per  cent  of  the  population  in  1688,  while  the  social  tables  
constructed  by  Campbell  (2008:  940)  for  1290  suggest  that  this  proportion  may  have  
been as high as 26 per cent in the medieval period. 
25 

========26========

The above interpretation is consistent with the weak Malthusian model. However,  
there  is  an  important  way  in  which  pre-industrial  England  does  not  fit  the  Malthusian  
interpretation, either strong or weak. This is the important role of the growth of London.  
Whereas Malthus clearly thought in terms of a negative relationship between population  
density  and real  income  levels through  diminishing  returns, there  is  much  evidence  to  
suggest that the growth of London acted as a stimulus to productivity and real income  
levels (Wrigley, 1985; Allen, 2009). This is more in line with the positive relationship  
between  population  density  and  real  income  levels hypothesised by Boserup (1965;  
1981), through effects on intensity of land use in surrounding rural areas and investment  
in  density-dependent  infrastructure  in  the  metropolitan  centre,  thus  creating  increasing  
rather  than  diminishing  returns.  Furthermore,  Campbell  et  al.  (1993)  demonstrate  the  
positive  influence  of  the  large  London  market  on  the organisation of agricultural  
production in the surrounding counties already during the medieval period, thus casting  
doubt on a fundamental assumption of the Malthusian model long before the Industrial  
Revolution. 
2. Real GDP and GDP per capita in Great Britain, 1700-1870 
For the period 1700-1870, our estimates of real GDP are for the territory of Great Britain.  
We  have  assumed  that  British  agriculture  can  be  represented  by  developments  in  
England, so that the addition of Wales and Scotland merely raises the level of production,  
leaving  the  trend  and  annual  fluctuations  unchanged.  The  time  series  for  industry  and  
services refer to the territory of Great Britain. As for the pre-1700 period, sectoral value  
added weights in Table 20 are derived from the current price GDP estimates obtained by  
26 

========27========

reflating the real output series, with the absolute levels established using an input-output  
table for 1841, derived from Horrell et al. (1994), but adjusted from a United Kingdom to  
a Great Britain basis. 1700 weights are used for the period 1700-1740, 1759 weights for  
1740-1780, 1801 weights for 1780-1820 and 1841 weights for 1820-1870. Details of the  
derivation of sectoral weights are provided in Broadberry and van Leeuwen (2010b). 
Putting the three main sectors together using the weights from Table 20, we arrive  
at the annual index of British real GDP shown in Figure 11. Our series shows much the  
same  pattern  of  trend  growth  acceleration  as  the  Crafts-Harley  data. This  can  be  seen  
clearly in Table 21, which presents the annual growth rates of aggregate output over the  
conventional sub-periods calculated using both the raw annual data and 10-year averages,  
together with the Crafts-Harley estimates for comparison. Figure 11 shows clearly that  
the fastest growth was in industry and the slowest growth in agriculture, with services  
exhibiting an intermediate growth rate. 
To see what happened to per capita incomes, it is necessary to provide estimates  
of  the  total  population of  Great Britain.  From  1801  onwards,  annual  data  on  the  
population of England, Wales and Scotland are available from Mitchell (1988: 9). For the  
period before 1801, the population of England has been reconstructed firmly by Wrigley  
and Schofield (1989) and Wrigley et al. (1997). Since less information is available for  
Wales  and  Scotland,  we  assume that the  ratio  of  the  population  of  Wales  to  England  
remained the same for the period 1700-1801. For Scotland, we have population estimates  
27 

========28========

for  1700  and  1750  (Schofield,  1994: 93).  Other  years  are  interpolated  using  the  
population of England.  
Combining the GDP series with the population data produces our estimates of per  
capita income in Figure 12. Table 22 presents the same material in growth rate form. The  
main findings are that per capita income growth accelerated considerably between 1780  
and 1801, and then slowed down between 1801 and 1830, before accelerating again after  
1830. For the period 1700-1870 as a whole, per capita income grew at an annual rate of  
0.48 per cent using the 10-year average data. 
VI. CROSS-CHECKING THE OUTPUT ESTIMATES 
1. Consumption and output 
One way  of  assessing the credibility of the output estimates is to see what they imply  
about the level and sufficiency of consumption per head. Table 23 assesses the supply of  
kilocalories  available  per  head  of the  population. Livi-Bacci  (1991)  believes  that  for  a  
population  to  have  been  adequately  fed  required  an  average  food  intake  of  2,000  
kilocalories per capita per day, although for a largely agrarian economy such as medieval  
England, it is reasonable to assume that some of the kilocalories requirements could have  
been met from home-raised vegetables and poultry, together with wild nuts, berries, fish  
and game. We should thus be looking for the main arable crops and pastoral products of  
the agricultural sector to produce around 1,500 kilocalories per person per day to meet  
the subsistence needs of the population.  
28 

========29========

The estimates suggest that agricultural output was more than sufficient to meet  
society‟s needs after the Black Death, but was significantly less so in 1310/19, the decade  
of the Great Famine. The picture of English society in the half century before the Black  
Death that emerges from this table is thus one of an economy under pressure. Note also  
that  it  is  hard  to  see  how a  population  much  above  the 4.72 million average  over  the  
decade 1300/09 could have been sustained, given the grain yields and the levels of land  
use  underpinning  the  output  estimates. Even  allowing  for  a  10 per  cent higher  arable  
production in the non-demesne-sector, as suggested by Stone (2006), would not change  
the picture dramatically, as can be seen in the final column. 
One issue which is apparent from Table 23 and from the very high share of the  
pastoral  sector  highlighted  in  Table  9 is  that  a  lot  of  land  was  devoted  to  producing  
relatively  expensive  kilocalories.  Thus  the  medieval  English  population  does  not  seem  
particularly well off if living standards are assessed in terms of kilocalories. However, the  
diet was highly varied, with a large proportion of the population able to consume meat,  
dairy produce and ale. This is in striking contrast to a strongly Malthusian economy, with  
real  wages  driven  down  to  bare  bones  subsistence,  where  the  bulk  of  the  population  
would  be  deriving  the  majority  of their  kilocalories  from  inferior grains  with  little  
processing, such as oatmeal (Allen, 2009: 35-37). 
2. Income and output based measures 
An alternative way to assess the credibility of our output estimates is to compare them  
with  the  long-established  estimates  of  real  wages.  Phelps  Brown  and  Hopkins  (1981)  
29

produced long time series of daily real wages for skilled and unskilled building workers,  
which apparently painted a picture of Malthusian fluctuations but long run stationarity of  
material  living  standards  over  the  period  1270-1870. Subsequent  refinements  by  Allen  
(2001) present a more subtle picture, with the real wage gains following the Black Death  
being  maintained  in  Britain  and  Holland,  but  eaten  away  by  subsequent  population  
growth  in  the  rest  of  Europe.  Clark  (2005)  continues  to  show  a  substantial  decline  in  
British real wages from their medieval peak before recovery  from the mid-seventeenth  
century. Figure 13 charts our per capita GDP estimates together with the Allen and Clark  
real wage series for unskilled building workers. Real GDP per capita moves more closely  
in line with the Allen real wage series until the mid-eighteenth century, but after 1750  
trends in GDP per capita have more in common with the Clark real wage series.  
How should we interpret the approximate doubling of per capita income between  
1270 and 1700? We have seen in Table 23 that gains in food consumption per capita over  
this period were relatively modest, at least measured in terms of kilocalories. The gains in  
material living standards should thus be seen as arriving more through the consumption  
of industrial goods and services. This shows up in the path of average wealth at death and  
the growing urbanisation of the British economy. Overton (2006) uses data on probate  
inventory  totals  for  Cornwall,  Hertfordshire,  Kent,  Lincolnshire  and  Worcestershire  to  
show that between 1550 and 1750, median wealth increased from £11.31 to £22.35 in  
constant  prices.  Furthermore,  looking  at  sub-periods,  Overton  finds  a  decrease  in  per  
capita wealth between 1550 and 1620, when GDP per capita also had a slightly negative  
trend. Malanima (2009a) suggests an urbanisation ratio for England rising from 4.0 per  
30

cent in 1300 to 13.2 per cent by 1700 and 43.0 per cent by 1870, using settlements of at  
least 10,000 as the cut-off.  
VII. BRITAIN IN AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE 
This  paper  on  British  GDP  over  the  long  run  is  part  of  a  project  to  reconstruct  the  
historical  national  accounts  of  Britain  and  Holland.  In  addition,  estimates  of  GDP  per  
capita are now available for a number of other countries before 1850. Table 24 thus puts  
the British experience into a wider international perspective, projecting backwards from  
Maddison‟s (2003) widely accepted estimates of GDP per capita in 1850, expressed in  
1990 international dollars. However, it is necessary to take care to deal with changes in  
the territory under consideration.  
Whereas Maddison works with constant boundaries for the United Kingdom for  
the  whole  period,  our  estimates  refer  to  Great Britain  for  the  period  1700-1870  and  
England  for  the  period  before  1700.  Similarly,  while  Maddison  works  with  constant  
boundaries  for  the Netherlands,  the  estimates  of  van  Leeuwen  and  van  Zanden  (2009)  
refer to the Netherlands for the period 1800-1870 and Holland for the period before 1800.  
The changing fortunes of Great Britain/England and the Netherlands/Holland are tracked  
in part A of Table 24, with other countries being brought into the comparison in panel B.  
In the cases of both England and Holland, per capita incomes in the late Middle Ages  
were of the order of $1,000, well above Maddison‟s figure of $400 in 1000. Even on the  
eve of the Black Death, we find per capita incomes in England and Holland of more than 
$800.  The figure  of  $400,  or  a  little  more  than  a  dollar  a  day,  is  usually  taken  as  the  
31 

========32========

measure  of  bare  bones  subsistence,  and  is  observed  for  many  poor  countries  in  the  
twentieth  century.  Estimates  for  other  European  countries  in  part  B  of  Table  24 also  
suggest late medieval living standards well above $400. In some cases, such as Italy, this  
may  be  explained  by  high  levels  of  urbanisation.  For  Western Europe  as  a  whole,  
however, it is explained by mixed agriculture with a large pastoral sector. 
The large share of pastoral agriculture had a number of important implications for  
future growth. First, this was a high value added agriculture, even if it did not produce  
many more kilocalories per head than arable agriculture. Second, this was a highly capital  
intensive agriculture, with animals making up a large share of the capital stock. Third,  
this  was  an  agriculture  which  was  highly  intensive  in  the  use  of  non-human  energy.  
Fourth,  the  large  pastoral  sector  provided  enhanced  employment  opportunities  for  
females, thus underpinning a relatively high age of marriage for women, which reduced  
fertility rates and encouraged human capital formation (de Moor and van Zanden, 2010;  
Voigtländer and Voth, 2010). 
In these respects, Western Europe already looked very different from Asia long  
before  what  Pomeranz  (2000)  calls  the  Great  Divergence  of  the  industrial  revolution  
period. Broadberry  and  Gupta  (2006)  point  out  that  during  the  early  modern  period  
European wages were significantly above Asian wages, if compared at the exchange rate  
(the silver wage) rather than the amount of grain they could purchase (the grain wage).  
This was taken to suggest a higher European productivity in traded goods and services, so  
that although European consumers could enjoy more industrial goods and services, they  
32 

========33========

did  not  necessarily  enjoy  more  agricultural  goods.  Yet  even if  European  and  Asian  
consumption baskets were broadly similar in terms of the kilocalories they contained, it  
now  looks  as  though  Europeans  (especially  those  able  to  afford  the  „respectability  
basket”)  consumed  more  agricultural  value-added  than  many  Asians  because  of  the  
greater direct and indirect contribution made by animals to the contents of that basket. 
The per capita GDP estimates for India in Table 24B, taken from Broadberry and Gupta  
(2009)  suggests  that  although  Indian  living  standards  were  higher  at  the  peak  of  the  
Mughal  Empire  than  in  the  nineteenth  century,  they  were  already  by  this  stage  
substantially lower than in the most developed parts of Western Europe. 
VIII. CONCLUSIONS 
This  paper  provides  the  first  annual  estimates  of  GDP  for  England between  1270  and  
1700 and for Great Britain between 1700 and 1870, constructed from the output side. For  
agriculture, the estimates rest on a detailed reconstruction of arable and pastoral farming,  
built up from manorial records during the medieval period, probate inventories during the  
early  modern  period  and  farm  accounts  during  the  modern  period.  For  industry  and  
services, indices of gross output are assembled for the major sectors and combined with  
value  added  weights.  The  GDP  data  are  then  combined  with  population  estimates  to  
calculate GDP per capita.  
Our results suggest English per capita income growth of 0.20 per cent per annum  
between  1270  and  1700,  with  the  strongest  growth  after  the  Black  Death  and  in  the  
second  half  of  the  seventeenth century. For  the  period  1700-1870,  we  find  British per  
33 

========34========

capita  income  growth  of  0.48 per  cent per  annum,  broadly  in  line  with  the  widely  
accepted estimates of Crafts and Harley (1992). This modest trend growth in per capita  
income  before  the  Industrial  Revolution suggests  that,  working  back  from  the  present,  
living standards in the late medieval period were well above “bare bones subsistence”.  
This can be reconciled with modest levels of kilocalorie consumption per head because of  
the very large share of pastoral production in agriculture. Contrary to the claims of the  
California  School,  Western  Europe  was  on  a  very  different  path  of  development  from  
Asia  long  before  the  Great  Divergence,  characterized  by  high  value  added,  capital  
intensive and non-human energy intensive production.

Sources  and  notes:  Kilocalories  per  bushel  for  the  medieval  period  are  taken  from  Campbell et al. (1993: 41). Following Overton and Campbell (1996: Table XIII), storage  losses are assumed to have been 10%, with food conversion losses of 20% for wheat and  rye, 22% for barley, and 44% for oats when processed into bread, and 70% for barley and  oats when malted and brewed into ale/beer. For the post Black Death period (1380/89 to  1450/59) patterns of grain consumption are assumed to have been equivalent to those for  1600 given by Overton and Campbell (1996: Table XII): 98% of wheat and rye and all  oats not fed to livestock were eaten. However, we assumed that 50% of barley was eaten  and  the  remainder  brewed.  For  the  pre-Black  Death  period  it  is  assumed  that  60%  of  barley  was  eaten  and  only  40%  brewed.  For  1600-1850  the  estimates  of  Overton  and  Campbell (1996: Tables XII and XIII) were followed. 
*Includes net grain imports and potatoes.
