Abstract: This paper provides the first annual GDP series for Great Britain over the period 1700-1870. The series is constructed in real terms from the output side, using volume indicators and value added weights. Sectoral estimates are provided for agriculture, industry and services, and for a number of sub-sectors. Estimates of nominal GDP are also provided, based on a benchmark for 1841 and projected back to 1700 and forward to 1870 using the real output series and sectoral price indices. The new data are used to provide a consistent account of economic growth and the business cycle. The results are broadly consistent with the long run path of real output suggested by Crafts and Harley, although growth rates for sub-periods differ, largely as a result of changes in the growth of agriculture. Nominal GDP increased more rapidly than suggested by Lindert and Williamson during the eighteenth century, and more slowly than suggested by Deane and Cole during the first half of the nineteenth century, as a result of differences in the price indices. We also refine the business cycle chronologies of Ashton and Gayer, Rostow and Schwartz.

I. INTRODUCTION 
This paper provides an annual series of gross domestic product for Great Britain over 
the period 1700-1870, built up from the output side. For the period 1700-1830, the 
estimates of Crafts and Harley (1992) provide observations of sectoral and aggregate 
output only for a small number of benchmark years, while for the period 1830-1870, 
Deane’s (1968) annual estimates are available only by category of expenditure. 
Sectoral estimates are provided here for agriculture, industry and services, and also 
for a number of sub-sectors, built up using volume series available on an annual basis, 
and aggregated using value added weights. Estimates of nominal GDP are also 
constructed by combining the real output series with price indices to project 
backwards to 1700 and forwards to 1870 from an 1841 benchmark. 
We use the new annual series to provide a consistent account of growth and 
the business cycle in Britain over this period. The results are broadly consistent with 
the long run path of real output suggested by Crafts and Harley (1992), although 
growth rates for sub-periods differ, largely as a result of changes in the growth of 
agriculture. Nominal GDP increased more rapidly than suggested by Lindert and 
Williamson (1982) during the eighteenth century, and more slowly than suggested by 
Deane and Cole (1967) during the first half of the nineteenth century, as a result of 
differences in the price indices. We also refine the business cycle chronologies of 
Ashton (1959) and Gayer, Rostow and Schwartz (1953). A sister paper by Broadberry 
et al (2010) provides annual estimates of GDP for England covering the period 1270- 
1700. The current paper thus forms a convenient link between this account of 
medieval and early modern economic growth and the more familiar accounts of 
British economic growth since 1870, based on the annual data of Feinstein (1972).

The paper proceeds as follows. Sections II to IV describe the procedures for 
estimating real output in agriculture, industry and services, respectively. For 
benchmark years, we demonstrate broad consistency of long run growth rates with the 
widely-accepted approach of Crafts and Harley (1992). For each of the main sectors, 
annual observations are graphed, while more information is also provided on the main 
sub-sectors within agriculture, industry and services. Section V presents annual 
estimates of GDP in current as well as constant prices. The constant price GDP series 
is combined with population in section VI to provide estimates of GDP per capita. 
Section VII conducts an analysis of the business cycle in aggregate GDP and 
compares it to previous business cycle chronologies. The conclusion is followed by a 
data appendix, setting out detailed data sources. 
II. AGRICULTURE 
1. Overview of sources and methods 
Deane and Cole (1967) measured agricultural output by assuming constant corn 
consumption per capita and making a small adjustment for foreign trade. This was 
criticised by Crafts (1976), who regarded the assumption of constant per capita 
consumption of corn as indefensible while real incomes were rising and the relative 
price of corn was changing. Crafts (1985: 39-42) used a hybrid method to calculate 
the growth of agricultural output over the period 1700-1830. For the period 1700-60, 
he used the demand approach with an assumed income elasticity of demand of 0.7 and 
an iterative procedure for ensuring consistency between agricultural income and 
national income growth. For the period 1760-1801, and also for 1801-31, he allowed 
for relative price changes with an assumed price elasticity of demand of -0.8, and 

========4========

4 
checked the results against an alternative method of deflating agricultural incomes 
with an agricultural price index. 
Allen (1994) showed that it was possible to construct estimates of agricultural 
output directly using volume and price data published in the Agrarian History of 
England and Wales by Chartres (1985), Bowden (1985), Holderness (1989) and John 
(1989). He also showed that for the period 1700-1850 as a whole, the volume method 
yields a similar increase in output between 1700 and 1850 as the demand-based and 
deflated value-added methods employed by Crafts. Allen (2005) provides alternative 
estimates for benchmark years covering the longer time span of 1300-1850, but with a 
somewhat slower output growth over the period 1700-1850 than suggested by Allen 
(1994). 
The approach taken in this paper is the estimation of value added in 
agriculture on an annual basis, built up from quantity and price information for 
individual products. Results are presented for individual products and for the arable 
and pastoral sub-sectors, as well as for total agriculture. The data are taken largely 
from the Modern Farm Accounts Database assembled by Turner et al. (2001) and the 
Early Modern Probate Inventories Database of Overton, Whittle, Dean and Haan 
(2004), supplemented with additional information from Clark (2004), and the 
Agrarian History of England and Wales. For arable farming we have annual gross 
yields for all products for most years, although there are significant gaps for rye as it 
became less and less important over time. 

========5========

5 
For the pastoral sector, the data are drawn from the Early Modern Probate 
Inventories Database between 1700 and 1750. Animal stocking densities (the number 
of animals per sown acre) are multiplied with the sown acreage to yield estimates of 
the total numbers of animals in England. After 1750, benchmark estimates of the 
numbers of animals from John (1989) and Allen (2005) are interpolated with data on 
the sale of animals at Smithfield from Mitchell (1988: 708-709). Multiplying the 
resulting numbers of animals with the percentages of animals producing and the 
production per animal results in total production in the pastoral sector. 
2. Arable farming 
The starting point for any estimate of arable sector output must be the total sown 
acreage and its breakdown by crop, shown here in Table 1. The acreage by crop in 
benchmark years is taken from Holderness (1989: 145) and Chartres, (1985: 444), 
with the absolute level pinned down by Prince’s (1989: 41) interpretation of the 1801 
Crop Returns. 
The next step is to estimate average grain yields per acre. Weighted national 
average yields per acre, gross of tithe and seed can be obtained from the Early 
Modern Probate Inventories Database and the Modern Farm Accounts Database. Each 
dataset has been divided into seven regional groupings and separate chronologies 
have been constructed fro each region before being combined into a single weighted 
master chronology for the country as a whole. Due to the discontinuous nature of 
much of the data, the regional chronologies are derived using regression analysis with 
dummy variables for each farm and for each year, as suggested by Clark (2004). 

========6========

6 
Grain yields gross of seed as well as tithe are shown in Figure 1 for wheat, rye, 
barley, oats and pulses. From these gross yields it is necessary to subtract grain used 
as seed to derive the net yields shown in Table 2 for all the major crops. From these 
gross yields it is necessary to subtract grain used as seed to derive the net yields 
shown in Table 2. Net yields increased strongly for all grains, with oats and wheat 
showing bigger increases than barley and rye. 
In addition to making allowance for grain used as seed, the derivation of net 
output in arable farming requires the subtraction of grain used to feed working 
animals. For the first half of the eighteenth century, estimates of the numbers of 
working animals per sown acre can be obtained from the Early Modern probate 
inventories Database, which can be multiplied with the sown acreage to produce 
estimates of the numbers of working animals in Table 3. From the mid-eighteenth 
century, oxen numbers are assumed to decline steadily to zero by 1870, while horses 
are estimated from Allen (1994). Using assumptions about consumption of oats and 
pulses by mature and immature animals, it is possible to derive estimates of farm 
animal consumption, which are then subtracted from gross output to arrive at arable 
output net of seed and animal consumption in Table 4. The output of wheat, the 
principal bread grain, increased steadily until the mid-nineteenth century, while the 
output of rye, an inferior bread grain, declined in absolute as well as relative terms. 
Barley, the principal brewing grain saw a rapid growth from the mid-eighteenth 
century, while oats, which came to be used increasingly as horse fodder, fluctuated 
more erratically. The output of potatoes increased dramatically throughout the period, 
while the output of pulses increased much more gradually. 

========7========

3. Pastoral farming 
The starting point for the estimation of pastoral farming output is the numbers of non- 
working animals in Table 5. For the first half of the eighteenth century, these are 
derived from the stocking densities in the Early Modern Probate Inventories Database. 
For later years, estimates for benchmark years are derived from Allen (2005), John 
(1989), Mitchell (1988) and Turner (1998), and interpolated using data on annual 
sales at Smithfield and the \metropolitan Cattle market from Mitchell (1988: 708) and 
Perren (1975: 388). All animal types increased in number, leading to a substantial 
increase in livestock units per 100 acres. 
The proportions of animals assumed to have been producing milk, meat and 
wool are set out in Table 6. A high proportion of cows are assumed to have produced 
milk and a high proportion of sheep to have yielded wool. Meat, however, was 
produced only by those animals that were slaughtered. Slaughter rates for 1700 and 
1850 are derived from Holderness (1989) and Clark (1991). The next step in the 
calculation of pastoral output involves the estimation of yields of milk, meat and wool 
per animal, set out in Table 7. Data between benchmark years were interpolated using 
information on the relative prices of pastoral products and the animals from which 
they were derived. Table 8 then combines the information on numbers of animals, 
percentages producing and yields per animal to arrive at the estimates of total output 
in the pastoral farming sector. 
Further assumptions are needed to derive output estimates for hay, hides and 
skins and dairy products. Hay output is derived from the numbers of non-farm horses, 
on the assumption that each horse consumed 2.4 tons of hay per year (Allen, 2005). 

========8========

8 
Output of hides and skins is derived from the numbers of working and non-working 
animals, using assumptions on the percentages of each animal producing and yields 
per animal from Clark (1991) and Clarkson (1989). In the dairy sector, output is split 
between cheese, butter and fresh milk using data from Holderness (1989). 
4. Total agricultural output 
Multiplying the output volumes by their prices yields the total value of net output. 
The price data are taken largely from Clark (2004), who synthesises the published 
data of Beveridge (1939), Thorold Rogers (1866-1902: volumes 1-30) and the multi- 
volume Agrarian History of England and Wales, as well as integrating new archival 
material. Output can be valued in both current prices and in constant 1700 prices. 
Figure 2 plots arable, pastoral and total agricultural output in constant prices 
on a logarithmic scale. Pastoral output grew at a faster rate than arable output, 
particularly from the mid-eighteenth century. The pastoral sector thus increased its 
share of agricultural output in constant prices. In Table 9, we see that the share of 
pastoral products in current prices also increased substantially from the mid- 
eighteenth century, as relative prices changed only over relatively short periods. 
One finding from Table 9 that is worth emphasising is the high share of the 
pastoral sector in agricultural value added, even at the beginning of the eighteenth 
century. Its subsequent growth meant that by the late nineteenth century, the pastoral 
sector accounted for nearly 60 per cent of agricultural output. This meant that 
although the British people did not have a particularly generous diet if viewed in 

========9========

9 
terms of kilocalories, it was a varied diet, with meat, dairy produce and ale to 
supplement the less highly processed grain products that made uo the bulk of the diet. 
Table 10 presents the total agricultural output index from Figure 2 in growth 
rate for, using both annual data and 10-year averages to capture long run trends. Over 
the 1700-1830 period as a whole, our agricultural growth rate is very similar to that of 
Crafts (1985) and Crafts and Harley (1992), although there are considerable 
differences over shorter periods. In particular, in common with the volume indices 
calculated by Allen (1994: 102) and Overton (1996: 75), we do not find the marked 
slowdown in the third quarter of the eighteenth century suggested by Crafts and 
Harley. 
III. INDUSTRY 
1. Overview of sources and methods 
Industry is the one sector for which data have previously been analysed at annual 
frequency, building on the pioneering work of Hoffmann (1955). However, as Crafts 
(1985) and Harley (1982) pointed out independently, Hoffmann (1955) inadvertently 
overstated the growth rate of industrial output during the Industrial Revolution as a 
result of his weighting procedures. The problem is that a few industrial branches, 
most notably cotton and iron, grew much more rapidly than the rest of industry, and 
these branches are included in Hoffmann’s data set. However, the available time 
series cover only 56 per cent of industrial output, and the weights of these industries 
are increased proportionally to achieve 100 per cent coverage of industrial output. But 
this means that the unrepresentative, rapidly growing branches of cotton and iron 
effectively have their weights doubled. Harley (1982) and Crafts et al. (1989) propose 

========10========

10 
that only the weights of industries other than cotton and iron should be increased to 
arrive at 100 per cent coverage. 
In addition to changing the weighting scheme, Harley (1982) and Crafts et al. 
(1989) also replaced some of the older series used by Hoffmann (1955), drawing on 
the latest scholarship. We use these series, together with some later additions, the 
most important of which are the new series of bar iron output from King (2005), 
Feinstein’s (1988: 446) series of investment in total buildings and works for output of 
the building industry, and an index of new English language book titles derived from 
the English Short Title Catalogue and the British Library for the output of the printing 
industry. Our weighting scheme is very similar to that of Crafts et al. (1989), but 
modified to allow for the inclusion of the printing industry. 
2. Results for total industry 
Figure 3 presents our series for industrial output, together with the “revised best 
guess” series of Crafts and Harley (1992) and Hoffmann’s (1955) original index for 
contrast. The biggest difference is between the Hoffmann index and the other two 
indices, as a result of the excessive weight given to cotton textiles and iron in the 
former. Our series shows slightly slower growth than the Crafts-Harley index during 
the early eighteenth century, largely as a result of the inclusion of new series, 
particularly King’s (2005) data for the iron industry. From the mid-eighteenth century 
onwards, differences between the two series are relatively minor, and essentially 
confirm the picture originally presented in Crafts et al. (1989). Output growth 
accelerated from around 1740 to 1840 before tapering off. Again, there is quite a 
substantial cyclical dimension to industrial output. Table 12 presents the annual 

========11========

11 
growth rates of industrial output over the conventional sub-periods calculated using 
both the raw annual data and 10-year averages, together with the Crafts-Harley 
estimates for comparison. 
3. Results for industrial sub-sectors 
Part A of Figure 4 provides a breakdown of industrial production into manufacturing, 
building and mining. Both mining and building grew more rapidly than total 
manufacturing over the period as a whole. Part B of Figure 4, however, shows that 
total manufacturing output included some very rapidly growing branches. The most 
rapid growth was in metal production, driven by the iron industry. The next most 
rapid growth was in textiles, driven by the dramatically expanding cotton industry, but 
slowed down by the relative decline of the more traditional textile industries. Food 
drink and tobacco and other manufacturing grew more slowly. 
IV. SERVICES 
1. Overview of sources and methods 
The service sector has received much less attention from economic historians than 
agriculture and industry, and there have been no previous attempts to provide annual 
frequency data. The first estimates for benchmark years were provided by Deane and 
Cole (1967), but have been revised downwards by Crafts (1985), particularly for the 
early nineteenth century. For the eighteenth century Deane and Cole (1967: 76-78) 
assumed that “commerce” grew at the same rate as industry, that “rent and 
miscellaneous services” increased in line with population, and that “government and 
defence” could be measured by real public expenditure. Crafts (1985: 35-37) made 
only minor changes here. For the nineteenth century, however, Deane and Cole (1967: 

========12========

12 
166) derived estimates of income in “trade and transport”, “domestic and personal”, 
“housing”, “government, professional and other services” and deflated them by the 
Rousseaux price index. Crafts (1985: 31) showed that this produces an implausibly 
high rate of growth for commerce, and assumed instead that commerce grew in line 
with national income, thus introducing an element of iteration into the estimates. 
Crafts (1985: 35-37) used employment growth for domestic and personal services and 
new estimates of the housing stock for housing. He also revised the growth rate of 
government using new data on employment growth. 
Our estimates are broadly consistent with those of Crafts (1985), but make a 
few changes to reflect the need for annual data. The most important difference is in 
commerce, where we measure the growth of output using volume series covering 
distribution, transport, finance and other commerce. This produces results which are 
not far out of line with the Deane and Cole (1967) assumption for the eighteenth 
century, that commerce grew in line with industry. This also avoids the iterative 
element in the Crafts (1985) assumption that commerce grew in line with national 
income during 1801-30, and ensures consistency of treatment throughout the whole 
period. 
For government, we use civil government and defence expenditure throughout 
the whole period, deflated using the Schumpeter-Gilboy and Rousseaux price indices 
from Mitchell (1988: 719-723). For housing, we use the stock estimates of Feinstein 
(1988: 389), using a regression relationship between housing stock and population to 
fill in gaps. Output of domestic and personal services is assumed to rise in line with 
population throughout the whole period, following Deane and Cole (1967) and Crafts 

========13========

13 
(1985). This inevitably produces a relatively stable path for output in domestic and 
personal services, which is consistent with most assessments of this sector. 
2. Results for total services 
Our annual index of service sector output is plotted in Figure 5. The trend pattern is of 
an increase in the growth rate from around 1780. As is usually the case, fluctuations 
in services were milder than in industry or agriculture. Table 13 presents the annual 
growth rates of services output over the conventional sub-periods calculated using 
both the raw annual data and 10-year averages, together with the Crafts-Harley 
estimates for comparison. Our growth rate estimates are very close to the Crafts- 
Harley data over both the whole period 1700-1830 and individual sub-periods, and 
using both annual data and 10-year averages. 
3. Results for service sub-sectors 
Figure 6 provides more detail on the service sector. Part A provides information on 
commerce, government, housing and domestic services, while Part B breaks down 
commerce into transport, distribution, finance and other commerce. In Part A, we see 
that government grew most rapidly during the eighteenth century, albeit in a sharply 
cyclical fashion as a result of warfare. During the nineteenth century, commerce was 
clearly the fastest growing sector. Housing and domestic services grew more slowly 
but more steadily than government or commerce. The former two series coincide in 
the chart because domestic services were assumed to grow in line with population, 
whilst we found a unit elasticity between housing and population. In Part B, we see 
that distribution and finance grew more rapidly than transport and other commerce, 

========14========

14 
with finance particularly dynamic during the eighteenth century, but distribution more 
dynamic during the nineteenth century. 
V. GDP IN CONSTANT AND CURRENT PRICES 
The next step is to construct an index of real GDP from the above output series for 
agriculture, industry and services, using an appropriate set of weights. Table 14 sets 
out the weighting scheme, derived from the reconstruction of nominal GDP by sector. 
Real output trends from the sectoral series described earlier in the paper are 
transformed into current price trends using sectoral price deflators, with absolute 
levels of GDP in current prices established using an input-output table for 1841, 
derived from Horrell et al. (1994), but adjusted from a United Kingdom to a Great 
Britain basis. 1700 weights are use for the period 1700-1740, 1759 weights for 1740- 
1780, 1801 weights for 1780-1820 and 1841 weights for 1820-1870. Details of the 
derivation of the sectoral weights are provided in Broadberry and van Leeuwen 
(2010). 
Putting the three main sectors together using the weights from Table 14, we 
arrive at the annual index of real GDP shown in Figure 7 and presented in growth rate 
form in Table 15, together with the Crafts-Harley data for comparison. Our series 
shows much the same pattern of trend growth acceleration as the Crafts-Harley data, 
although there are some minor differences over shorter sub-periods, largely as a result 
of differences in agriculture. Figure 7 shows clearly that the fastest growth was in 
industry and the slowest growth in agriculture, with services exhibiting an 
intermediate growth rate. 

========15========

15 
These estimates of real GDP in index number form can be stated in constant 
prices simply by linking them to a benchmark estimate of GDP. We work with 1841 
as the benchmark year, based on our reworking of the Horrell et al. (1994) input- 
output table. Current price GDP can be obtained by reflating the real output indices by 
sector-specific price indices. For agriculture we construct a price index based on a 
weighted average of price series for individual agricultural products, taken largely 
from Clark (2004). The price index for the industrial sector is based on a weighted 
average of price series for industrial products from Clark (2004) and Beveridge 
(1939). For service sector prices, the key data are wage rates and house rents from 
Clark (2004), with some limited information on transport prices from Harley (1988) 
and Bogart (2005), and with distribution prices derived as a weighted average of 
agricultural and industrial prices. Using the price series for agriculture, industry and 
services to reflate real output in each sector yields the values for current price GDP 
shown in Figure 8. 
For comparison, we also show Deane and Cole’s (1967) current price GDP 
estimates for benchmark years in the nineteenth century, together with Lindert and 
Williamson’s (1982) benchmark figures for the eighteenth century. There is broad 
agreement over the long run trends, but our estimates suggest a higher nominal GDP 
in most years. A closer examination of the data for benchmark years in Table 2 
reveals that during the nineteenth century our estimates of nominal GDP grow 
substantially more slowly than the Deane and Cole (1967) estimates between 1801 
and 1851, but more rapidly after 1851. For the eighteenth century, our estimates grow 
substantially more rapidly than those of Lindert and Williamson (1982). 

========16========

16 
Figure 9 plots the price indices for the three main sectors together with the 
aggregate price index. Agricultural and service sector prices increased substantially 
during the second half of the eighteenth century, rising to a peak at the end of the 
Napoleonic Wars before falling back during the postwar deflation. By contrast, 
industrial prices increased much less during the eighteenth century and fell 
substantially more after 1815. Figure 10 therefore shows the expected pattern for the 
inter-sectoral terms of trade during the Industrial Revolution, with the relative price of 
agricultural goods increasing substantially, particularly from around 1780. 
Figure 10 plots real and nominal GDP together with the aggregate price level 
over the period 1700-1870. Most of the increase in nominal GDP was the result of 
real growth, with only a modest increase in the price level. Although there was a 
period of substantial inflation during the French and Napoleonic Wars, this was 
followed by a period of postwar deflation. 
VI. PER CAPITA INCOMES 
To see what happened to per capita incomes, it is necessary to provide estimates of 
the total population of Great Britain. From 1801 onwards, annual data on the 
population of England, Wales and Scotland are available from Mitchell (1988: 9). For 
the period before 1801, the population of England has been reconstructed firmly by 
Wrigley and Schofield (1989) and Wrigley et al. (1997) for the period since the 
compulsory registration of births, marriages and deaths. Since less information is 
available for Wales and Scotland, we assume that the ratio of the population of Wales 
to England remained the same for the period 1700-1801. For Scotland, we have 

========17========

17 
population estimates for 1700 and 1750 (Schofield 1994: 93). Other years are 
interpolated using the population of England. 
Combining the GDP series with the population data produces our estimates of 
per capita income in Figure 12. Table 17 presents the same material in growth rate 
form. The main findings are that per capita income growth accelerated considerably 
between 1780 and 1801, and then slowed down between 1801 and 1830, before 
accelerating again after 1830. For the period 1700-1870 as a whole, per capita income 
grew at an annual rate of 0.48 per cent using the 10-year average data. 
VII. BUSINESS CYCLE CHRONOLOGY 
The conventional business cycle chronology for the period 1700-1870 was established 
by Ashton (1959) for the eighteenth century and by Gayer et al. (1953) and Rostow 
(1972) for the nineteenth century, based on the NBER methodology of Burns and 
Mitchell (1946). This involved checking a large number of microeconomic time series 
and establishing turning points in “general business activity” as a “consensus of 
statistical data rather than turning-points in any particular magnitude such as national 
income” (Matthews, 1954: 2). The peak and trough years obtained with this 
methodology are shown in Table 18. The minor disagreements over turning points in 
the overlap period can be put down to the difficulties of assigning tuning points on an 
annual basis when monthly data would be more appropriate. Since growth rates are 
conventionally calculated between peaks, Table 18 suggests that there is likely to be 
some bias in the conventional periodisation used in the analysis of British economic 
growth. Picking peak years on the basis of the NBER methodology, the appropriate 

========18========

18 
periodisation would be 1701, 1761, 1783, 1802, 1831 and 1866 rather than 1700, 
1760, 1780, 1801, 1831 and 1870. 
Table 19 sets out the business cycle chronology obtained from the real GDP 
series constructed above, using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, with the smoothing 
parameter λ set equal to 100, following Backus and Kehoe (1992).1 Using a lower 
value of λ equal to 6.25, as suggested by Ravn and Uhlig (2002), reduces the 
amplitude but not the frequency of the business cycle. The cycle with λ equal to 100 
is graphed in Figure 13. If GDP can be taken as a more appropriate summary measure 
of “general business activity”, the correct periodisation would be 1701, 1761, 1780, 
1802, 1832, 1868. Given the disagreements on the precise dates of the turning points, 
we have taken 10-year averages based on the years traditionally analysed in the 
growth literature. 
VIII. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper provides the first estimates of GDP on an annual basis for Great Britain 
during the period 1700-1870. This enables us to analyse economic growth and the 
business cycle within a consistent framework. The results are broadly consistent with 
the long run path of real output suggested by Crafts and Harley (1992), although 
growth rates for sub-periods differ, largely as a result of changes in the growth of 
agriculture. Nominal GDP increased more rapidly than suggested by Lindert and 
Williamson (1982) during the eighteenth century, and more slowly than suggested by 
Deane and Cole (1967) during the first half of the nineteenth century, as a result of

differences in the price indices. We also refine the business cycle chronologies of 
Ashton (1959) and Gayer, Rostow and Schwartz (1953).

Source: Output gross of tithe and net of seed were derived by multiplying sown area from Table 1 with net yields from Table 2. The sown area from Table 1 was interpolated where necessary. Consumption by working animals was derived from the numbers of working animals shown in Table 3. For oats, outlying observations based on a very small number of inventories were dropped in 1700-09 and 1750-59, to eliminate excessive volatility.

APPENDIX 1: DATA SOURCES AND METHODS 
A. REAL OUTPUT SERIES 
1. Agriculture 
The weighting scheme is given in Table 9, and data sources are listed in the notes to Tables 1-8. 
2. Industry 
The weighting scheme presented in Table A1 is based on Hoffmann (1955), but modified as discussed in the text. The basic data are obtained from Hoffmann (1955), apart from the modifications listed below: 
Mining: coal: Pollard’s (1980) decadal estimates, interpolated using the Hoffmann series. 
Metals: Iron, steel and machine building: Hoffmann’s series is replaced for the period before 1839 using bar iron output from King (2005). The yearly data can be downloaded from the Economic History Society website at http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/Datasets/datasets.asp. Shipbuilding: Gross capital formation in ships from Feinstein (1988: 446), interpolated using the Hoffmann series. 
Textiles: Silk thread and goods: Mitchell (1988: 343) reports the imports of raw, thrown and waste silk for 1700-1825. These are used to extend the Hoffmann series. Linen yarn and cloth: Hoffmann’s series extended using linen yarn imports from Schumpeter (1960: 52). 
Food, Drink & Tobacco: Beer: Prior to 1787, the data are brought back in time by connecting an index of small, strong, and table beer charged with duty (Mitchell 1988: 404-405) to the Hoffmann index. Tobacco products: This series is extended back to 1700 with the value of imported tobacco at official prices from Mitchell (1988: 462-463). 
Other Manufacturing: Paper: Paper charged with duty from Mitchell (1988: 413). Printed matter: Index of new English language book titles (1700-1800) from the English Short Title Catalogue (http://www.rlg.org/estc.html). This is extended from 1800 to 1870 with an index of new titles from the Integrated Catalogue of the British Library (http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/?func=file&file_name=login-bl-list). The overlapping years show a high correlation, thus these two series can be linked together. Leather: Hoffmann’s series is extended back from 1801 to 1722 with an index of hides and skins charged with duty from Mitchell (1988: 416). Soap and candles: For the period prior to 1821, separate series are available for soap and candles from Mitchell (1988: 412, 415). Soap charged with duty is available back to 1713, while tallow candles charged with duty are available back to 1711. 
Building: The Hoffmann series is replaced with a constant price series of total buildings and works from Feinstein (1988: 446), available for 1761-1870 but with gaps. Timber imports from Mitchell (1988: 462) were used to interpolate. 
3. Services 
Weights of the four main service sectors are given as shares of total services in Table A2. These shares are taken from Crafts (1985: 16-17). Data sources are as follows: 3.1. Commerce 
Transport: We used shipping tonnage from Mitchell (1988: 534), the length of railways from Mitchell (1988: 541), total investment in waterways and roads from Ginarlis and Pollard (1988: 217-219) and the number of weekly passenger road 

========40========

40 
services from Bogart (2005: 487), which we interpolated assuming constant rates of growth. The index is created from the unweighted average of the available series. Financial services: We used the number of country banks from Pressnell (1956: 11), available for 1784, 1793, 1796, 1798, 1800-1842. These points were interpolated using the drawing accounts of the Bank of England from Mitchell (1988: 665) for 1720-1844, extended to 1870 with total deposits from Mitchell (1988: 658). The period 1700-1720 was projected using an exponential trend. We also used Pearson’s (2004: 374-375) series on fire insurance (real sum insured). The composite index was obtained as the unweighted average of the banking and insurance indices. 
Distribution: In the spirit of Deane and Cole’s (1967) work on the eighteenth century, we assumed that the growth of distribution is a weighted average of the growth of foreign trade and industry, with weights of 0.6 and 0.4 respectively. Checking the sensitivity of the results to changing the weights, we found that reducing the share of foreign trade to 30 per cent reduced the growth rate over the period 1700-1870 by just 0.2 percentage points. The data on exports and imports are taken from Mitchell (1988: 448-450). 
Other commerce: We assume that other commerce grew in line with industry. 
3.2 Domestic and personal services 
We assume that domestic and personal services grew in line with population, following the assumption of Deane and Cole (1967: 77) for the eighteenth century. 
3.3 Government 
We use civil government and defence expenditure from Mitchell (1988: 578, 587), deflated using the Schumpeter-Gilboy price index to 1800 and the Rousseaux price index after 1800, both from Mitchell (1988: 719, 722). 
3.4 Housing 
We use housing stock data from Feinstein (1988: 389), using a regression relationship between housing stock and population to fill in gaps. 
B. PRICE SERIES 
1. Agriculture 
Data are from Clark (2004, 2005, 2007), and can be downloaded from: http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/data.php#united.
