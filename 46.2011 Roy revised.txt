Empowering Women: Inheritance Rights and 
Female Education in India 
Sanchari Roy 
November 2011 
Abstract 
This paper examines the impact of women’s property inheritance rights on their education. Using exogenous variation created by state level reforms to the inheritance law in India, I d that mean educa- tional attainment of women who were of primary school-going age at the time of reform increased by 0.5 years in reforming relative to non- reforming states. The impact is present only for women in landowning and \Hindu" households, with no concomitant impact on men. I also provide suggestive evidence on the underlying mechanism that in order to prevent fragmentation of household property, parents compensate daughters by investing in their education.

The role of property rights in the process of economic development has 
been well-emphasized in the economic literature (North, 1990; De Soto, 2000; 
Besley, 1995; Banerjee, Gertler, and Ghatak, 2002; Field, 2007; DiTella, 
Galiani, and Schargrodsky, 2007). Property rights, through their impact 
on distribution of wealth, patterns of production as well as development of 
markets, especially credit markets, have evolved as one of the prerequisites 
of economic growth and poverty reduction (Besley and Ghatak, 2009). The 
primary focus of this literature has been to study the impact of property 
rights on physical investment, but the role of property rights in the context 
of human capital investment is relatively under-researched. Moreover, most 
of the existing research remains gender-neutral, with little attention to the 
salience of property rights for women. This paper attempts to  these gaps 
by studying the impact of property rights, particularly inheritance rights, on 
the human capital investment of women. 
The principal methodological problem faced in estimating the causal im- 
pact of property rights at the household level is that of potential endogeneity. 
There could be unobserved heterogeneity at the household level correlated 
with both female education and female property rights that may generate 
spurious results. For example, gender progressive parents may be more likely 
to invest in their daughters’ education as well as give them greater rights to 
family inheritance. This could lead to the classic omitted variable problem 
that would bias the estimates of the impact of female property rights. A 
second complication in this regard may arise due to measurement error as 
it is often di to obtain appropriate measures of female property rights 
due to the fact that women in many societies lack formal titles to property 
(Deere and Leon, 2003; Sweetman, 2008). This may introduce further biases 
in the estimates of the causal impact of female property rights on female

education. 
To address these problems, this paper exploits legislative changes to the 
central inheritance law in India as a source of exogenous variation in female 
inheritance rights. Like most personal laws in India, inheritance laws too vary 
by religion. The fundamental law governing present day inheritance rights 
of four religious communities i.e. Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs, called 
the Hindu Succession Act (HSA) of 1956, was designed to lay down a law of 
succession whereby sons and daughters would enjoy equal inheritance rights. 
In fact, however, signit gender inequalities persisted that disadvantaged 
daughters considerably. The main source of bias came from joint family 
property, to which sons enjoyed right by birth to an independent share but 
daughters did not. Both had equal rights of inheritance to the separate 
property that their father accumulated during his lifetime. But, due to the 
fact that a considerable amount of property, especially land in rural areas, is 
still jointly owned, such biased rights had a crippling e on the property 
ownership of women in India. 
The earliest attempts at amending this law were made by e Indian 
states, namely Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Maha- 
rashtra, between late 1970s and early 1990s. The amendments stated that 
women who were unmarried at the time the reform was passed in their state 
would be granted claims equal to that of their brothers in the joint family 
property, including the right to a share by survivorship (Agarwal, 1994).1 
The basic identi strategy in this paper uses the fact that exposure 
to the improved inheritance rights regime following the amendments was 
jointly determined by state of birth and year of birth. Not only did a woman 
have to be born in a state that passed the reform, she also had to be of

school-going age when the reform was passed in her state for it to have any 
impact on her schooling decisions. Hence, I identify the causal e of 
the reform, which I argue is exogenous2, by using a di 
methodology that compares mean educational attainment of women who 
were young enough to be exposed to the reform (\treated" group) to those 
who were too old (\control" group), between reforming and non-reforming 
states. The identifying assumption is that in the absence of the reform, 
the change in female educational attainment across cohorts would not have 
been systematically dit in reforming and non-reforming states. Similar 
strategies have been used by Du (2001), Card and Krueger (1992), Lemieux 
and Card (2001) etc. to estimate the e of education on earnings. 
However, if there exists unobservable factors that a female education 
and are also correlated with the passage of the reform, then the di 
in-di estimates would be biased. Therefore, in order to address this 
concern, I employ a triple di strategy by exploiting another source of 
variation within each state-cohort, namely land ownership status, religious 
a and gender. For example, in case of triple di using land 
ownership, I estimate the di in mean educational outcomes between 
women in the \treated" group relative the \control" group, for land-owning 
versus non land-owning households in reforming relative to non-reforming 
states. This would control for two kinds of potentially confounding trends: 
changes in educational outcomes of women belonging to landed households 
across states (that have nothing to do with the reform) and changes in ed- 
ucational outcomes of all women in the reforming states (e.g. due to other 
state policies that a everyone’s education). I do the same for \Hindu" 
versus \non-Hindu" households, as well as between women and men. 
2Concerns regarding the potential endogeneity of the reform process is discussed in Section 2.2.

========5========

I use individual level data obtained from multiple waves of the National 
Family and Health Survey of India (NFHS) for my analysis on female edu- 
cation. In these surveys, women aged 15-49 are interviewed on a number of 
socioeconomic and demographic dimensions, including age and educational 
attainment, which enables me to construct groups of women with varying 
degrees of exposure to the reform depending on their year of birth and state 
of residence.3 
The primary  of this paper is that exposure to the inheritance 
rights reform was associated with an increase of approximately 0.5 years of 
education (an improvement of around 0.2 standard deviations) for cohorts 
of women who were of primary school-going age at the time of the passage 
of reform. On the other hand, no e is observed for cohorts that were 16 
years or older at the time of the reform, suggesting that the  are less 
likely to be driven by correlated unobservables. 
Moreover, using triple di by land ownership, I  that the 
entire e comes from women who belong to land-owning households, and 
the estimated coet is larger at approximately 0.8. Similarly, using triple 
di by religion, I  that the impact to be present only for those 
women who were either Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jain (to whom the law 
applied), and the estimated coet is even larger at approximately 1.5. 
Finally, using triple di by gender, I  the impact to be present 
only for daughters with the estimated coet being 1.3-1.6, indicating 
that the reform was successful in narrowing the gap in education between 
boys and girls. 
This paper also attempts to shed light on the mechanism behind the

oberved impact of the inheritance rights reform on female education. Using 
individual-level data from the 1999 wave of the Rural Economic and Demo- 
graphic Survey (REDS), I  that the reform had virtually no impact on 
women’s likelihood of inheritance. However, this is not altogether surprising 
because incentives exist for parents to prevent the fragmentation of jointly 
owned family land (e.g. economies of scale in production, virilocality and vil- 
lage exogamy4, etc.), that has resulted in daughters continuing to be deprived 
of their share of inheritance in joint family property even after the reform 
in the law. Indeed, ethnographic evidence documented in Bates (2004)  
that the enunciation of progressive legislative changes to inheritance law in 
Maharashtra had no impact on women’s inheritance in practice. 
Instead, my  suggest that parents were compensating their daugh- 
ters for their disinheritance by transferring to them alternative forms of 
wealth. Traditionally, dowry payments have constituted the most common 
form of such transfers - a pre-mortem bequest to daughters in South Asia (An- 
derson, 2004; Goody, 1973). Using the REDS 99 dataset, I  that for those 
women who were past primary school-going age at the time of reform but 
not yet old enough to be married, dowry payments did rise by 0.4 percentage 
points, indicating that parents were still compensating these daughters in the 
traditional way for disinheriting them from joint family property. However, 
for women who were of primary school going-age at the time of reform, dowry 
payments are 0.36 percentage points lower compared to the control group. 
But note that this is the same group of women who also enjoyed higher ed- 
ucation as a result of exposure to the reform, suggesting that for them the 
4In virilocal societies, married daughters leave their parents’ home whereas married sons continue to live with their parents. Village exogamy, on the other hand, implies that daughters are married outside their village of residence. Both together imply that parents run the risk of losing control over their household property if their daughters inherit a share.

compensation from parents took the form of increased investment in their 
education. This is consistent with the  of Quisumbing and Otsuka 
(2001) in Sumatra who argue that land inheritance and schooling constitute 
dit forms of intergenerational transfers and observe a narrowing of the 
gender gap in schooling with the evolution of land tenure systems. 
My  therefore suggest that although progressive legislation aimed 
at improving inheritance rights of women in India did not have the desired 
 order e intrahousehold dynamics may have ensured that parents 
compensated their daughters for such disinheritance in a manner that re- 
sulted in an unintended but positive impact on female education. 
This paper relates to two dierent strands of literature. The literature 
on property rights has focused on the role of property rights in enhancing 
investment incentives in agricultural land (Banerjee, Gertler, and Ghatak, 
2002; Besley, 1995), residential investment (Field, 2007), entreprenurial in- 
vestment of retained earnings (Johnson, McMillan, and Woodru, 2003) etc. 
To the best of my knowledge, this paper is one of the  attempts to ex- 
plore the impact of property rights on human capital investment, within the 
speci context of women’s inheritance. The only other paper that is re- 
lated to mine is Deininger, Goyal, and Nagarajan (2010), which examines 
the impact of the amendment to the Hindu Succession Act (HSA) 1956 on 
women’s ability to inherit land and their socio-economic status (proxied by 
age at marriage and education) in two Indian states viz. Maharashtra and 
Karnataka. Apart from the fact that my analysis uses data from all the states 
of India and hence has greater external validity, the datasets and empirical 
methodologies used by the two papers are also dit.5 Both Deininger, 
5Deininger, Goyal, and Nagarajan (2010) use the 2006 wave of the Rural Economic and Demographic Survey, while I use multiple rounds of the National Family and Health Survey of India for my education results and the 1996 wave of the Rural Economic and Demographic Survey for my inheritance and dowry results.

Goyal, and Nagarajan (2010) and I  positive impact of the inheritance 
rights reform on female education, in which sense the two papers are com- 
plementary. However, compared to Deininger, Goyal, and Nagarajan (2010), 
I obtain an opposite result regarding probability of inheritance by women 
which, together with my analysis on dowry payments, allows me to identify 
an explicit mechanism underlying the increase in female educational attain- 
ment due to the inheritance rights reform, and is a key innovation of my 
paper. 
This paper also relates to the literature on dowry and marriage markets. 
A number of papers focus on the role of dowry as a spot price that clears the 
marriage market characterized by assortative wealth matching (Becker, 1981; 
Anderson, 2003, 2007; Rao, 1993; Edlund, 2001). On the other hand, dowry 
has also been studied as a \pre-mortem" bequest (Anderson, 2004; Goody, 
1973). In this context, it has been argued that change in the environment 
for producing bridal wealth, in the form of labour market expansion, may 
lead to reduction in prevalence of dowry (Botticini and Siow, 2003). My 
paper  well with such a line of argument as it shows that a legal reform in 
inheritance rights can have similar consequences on dowry payments through 
its impact on education, an alternative form of wealth transfer. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 1 describes 
the institutional background of Hindu inheritance law in India, while Section 
2 outlines the data and identi strategy. Section 3 presents results on 
female education, and Section 4 discusses a potential mechanism underlying 
the observed e by looking at the likelihood of inheritance by women and 
their dowry payments. Section 5 concludes.

1 The Institutional Background 
1.1 The Hindu Personal (Inheritance) Law 
As mentioned earlier, the laws for inheritance of property in India di by 
religion. The inheritance rights of Hindus are governed by the Hindu Suc- 
cession Act (HSA) of 1956, which also governs the rights of Buddhists, Jains 
and Sikhs.6 The Act was built on the foundation of ancient legal doctrines 
that have prevailed in India since the 12 century A.D., and purported to lay 
down a law of succession that gave equal rights of inheritance to sons and 
daughters. In fact, however, signit gender inequalities remained. 
A key feature of the legal structure of \Hindu" inheritance in India is 
the distinction between \joint family property" and \separate property".7 
Generally speaking, joint family property \consists principally of ancestral 
property (that is, property inherited from the father, paternal grandfather 
or paternal great-grandfather), plus any property that was jointly acquired 
or was acquired separately but merged into the joint property". Separate 
property, on the other hand, \includes that which was self-acquired (if ac- 
quired without detriment to the ancestral estate) and any property inher- 
ited from persons other than father, paternal grandfather or paternal great- 
grandfather" (Agarwal, 1994, p. 85-86). 
According to the Hindu Succession Act of 1956, daughters of a \Hindu" 
male dying intestate (i.e. without leaving a will)8 were equal inheritors, along 
6These religions are considered to be oots of Hinduism and hence are looked upon as being \Hindu-like" religions. For the rest of the paper, I will use the term \Hindu" to denote Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jain, that is all religions to which the HSA 1956 applied. 
7The joint family here is a legal concept and need not coincide with the joint residence or or any other aspect of a common household economy that may be implied in a sociological use of the term (Agarwal, 1994). 
8According to Deininger, Goyal, and Nagarajan (2010), the proportion of people who die without making a will in India is very high (around 65%, and probably even higher

with sons, of only their father’s separate property and his \notional" portion 
of joint family property, but had no direct inheritance rights to joint family 
property itself.9 10 Sons, on the other hand, not only inherited their share of 
the father’s own property and his \notional" portion of joint family property, 
but also had a direct right by birth to an independent share of the joint 
family property. In fact, all persons who acquired interest in the joint family 
property by birth were said to belong to the \Hindu coparcenary", which is 
conceptually similar to an exclusive male membership club in relation to the 
issue of inheritance to which women had no access.11 
In order to elaborate, I explain the scenario using a simple example. Let 
us consider a family consisting of a grandfather and his two sons, Son 1 and 
Son 2 (see Figure I). Let us assume that the family line begins with the 
grandfather, such that he has no predecessors. The  son has a son of 
his own (Grandson 1) as well as a daughter (Granddaughter 1), while for 
simplicity, I assume the second son is childless. The ancestral/joint fam- 
ily property owned by this family is say 1 acre, and nobody acquires any 
additional property during his/her lifetime i.e. \separate" property of any 
individual is zero (for simplicity). Bold letters indicate membership of the 
\Hindu" coparcenary. 
The process by which inheritance rights to this ancestral/joint family 
in rural areas), suggesting that the Hindu Succession Act is what ultimately determines inheritance patterns within the family. 
9The \notional" portion of the father’s share in the joint family property would be as- certained under the assumption of a \notional" or hypothetical partition of that property, as if the partition had taken place just before his death. 
10In case of a \Hindu" woman dying intestate, all her property devolves equally upon her sons and daughters and husband, if alive. If she has no children or other heirs with  right to her property, then the property devolution takes place according to the source of acquisition. 
11In addition to inheritance, sons could also demand partition of the joint family prop- erty while daughters could not. E.g. if the joint family property was a dwelling house, sons (as part of the coparcenary) could demand a partition of the same but daughters were only allowed right of residence but no right of ownership or possession. 
10 

========11========

Figure I: Ancestry 
property will be determined in this family is as follows (see Figure II): 
During the lifetime of the Grandfather, he himself along with his two 
sons, Son 1 and Son 2, each have a share of a third in the ancentral property 
(panel A of Figure II). Moreover, Son 1 shares his third equally with his own 
son, Grandson 1, since the latter is a member of the male coparcenary (along 
with his grandfather, his father and his uncle in this example) and hence has 
a right by birth to an \independent" share to joint family property (panel 
B). Hence Grandson 1 directly gets a sixth of joint family property as a male 
coparcener. Granddaughter 1, on the other hand, does not get any share of 
the joint family property directly. 
Now when Grandfather 1 dies (panel C), his share of a third gets split 
equally between his two living sons, Son 1 and Son 2, such that Son 1’s share 
now increases to a sixth (his coparcenery share) plus another sixth (inherited 
from his father), which totals to a third.12 Next, when Son 1 dies (panel D), 
his total share is split equally between Grandson 1 and Granddaughter 1, 
12Strictly speaking, the grandfather does not have to actually 
die for this so-called \partitioning" to be made: the inheritance shares are decided in a \notional" sense, as described in the earlier footnote. However, in practice, the most common reason behind a split or partition has to do with the death of the household head or patriarch (Foster and Rosenzweig, 2002). 
11 

========12========

Figure II: Inheritance 
i.e. each get a sixth. So, ultimately, Granddaughter 1 is entitled to a share 
of one-sixth (inheritance from her father) while her brother, Grandson 1, 
not only gets that one-sixth (inheritance from his father) but an additional 
one-sixth which is his coparcenery share. Thus Grandson 1’s  share is 
one-third, which is double that of his sister. 
Hence, it is apparent that the daughters su from discrimination in 
terms of inheritance under HSA 1956. Moreover, for the millions living in 
rural India, the most common form of property is land that is typically family- 
owned, which makes the gender bias in inheritance rights quite a signit 
phenomenon. Thus the law, by excluding the daughter from participating 
in the coparcenery ownership of ancestral property, not only discriminated 
12 

========13========

against her on grounds of gender, but also led to a negation of her funda- 
mental right of equality as guaranteed to her by the Indian Constitution 
(Ramanujam, 2005). 
1.2 State Amendments to the Hindu Succession Act 
The topic of inheritance in India is a \concurrent" one, i.e. one over which 
both the central and the state governments have legislative authority. Thus, 
although the HSA 1956 is a central law, some of the states have subsequently 
amended the HSA 1956. In particular, Kerala amended in 1976, Andhra 
Pradesh in 1986, Tamil Nadu in 1989, Maharashtra and Karnataka in 1994, 
following which daughters were granted independent inheritance rights and 
the right to a share by survivorship in joint family property, equal with 
their brothers, but only if they were unmarried at the time of the reform.13 
Such a reform opened up the entry of women into what had till now been 
an exclusively male preserve and sought to, at least partially, redress the 
concern of gender bias inherent in the original central law. I exploit these 
legislative amendments as a \natural experiment" to study the impact of a 
potential improvement in female inheritance rights on female education in 
India. 
13Kerala passed a slightly dit amendment in the form of the Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act that recognized all family members with an interest in the undivided family estate as being independent full owners of their shares from then onwards, i.e. abolished joint family property altogether. But since the spirit of this amendment was similar to those passed by the other reforming states, and could be expected to favourably a the inheritance of the daughter, I club them together. However, most of the  of this paper are robust to the exclusion of Kerala. 
13 

========14========

2 Data and Identi Strategy 
2.1 Data 
To estimate the causal impact of the inheritance rights reform on female 
education, I use household-level data from multiple rounds of the National 
Family Health Survey of India (NFHS) conducted in 1992, 1998 and 2005.14 
The NFHS is designed along the lines of the Demographic and Health Surveys 
(DHS) that have been conducted in many developing countries around the 
world, and are repeated cross-sections. 
The NFHS surveys, which are representative at the state level and have an 
overall response rate of 98 percent, contain detailed information, including 
educational attainment, on all individual members of the household. 29 
states of India are covered in the sample.15 However, the Hindu Succession 
Act (1956) did not apply to Jammu and Kashmir (Agarwal, 1994). Hence I 
drop that state from my analysis and are left with 28 states. 
I  focus on women who are daughters of the head of the household 
and who are at least 22 years of age at the time of survey (this ensures 
that women in the sample have completed their education).16 17 There are 
14The NFHS is carried out by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. 
15The 3 newest states of India, i.e. Chattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand, were created in 2000, out of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar respectively. They are part of the NFHS wave of 2005, but not of the waves of 1992 and 1998. Additionally, Sikkim is not a part of the 1992 wave. Smaller Union Territories like Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Pondicherry etc. are also excluded. 
16The  of this paper are robust to dit cut-o regarding age at time of survey. 
17Some of the mothers of these women may have been young enough to be exposed to the reform themselves, especially those born after 1965 in 1998 wave and those born after 1972 in 2005 wave. To avoid any confounding impact on outcomes of daughters through their mothers, I calculate the minimum age that mothers need to be in order to be unexposed to the reform: this is 44 years at the time of survey, which means that for example, in the 2005 wave, these women had to be born on or before 1961 such that they would be 15 or older at the time of the earliest reform (Kerala in 1976). Hence I restrict 
14 

========15========

18,691 such women in my sample, with year of birth spanning 1943 to 1984.18 
Summary statistics are presented for this sample in Table 1. Mean age for 
this sample of women is 27 years, while average level of education is 8.14 
years of completed education (6 years of education correspond to completion 
of primary school). Almost half of the sample women belong to households 
that own some land, 83 percent are \Hindu" and 45 percent live in urban 
areas. 
2.2 Identi Strategy 
The basic identication strategy used in this paper exploits the fact that ex- 
posure to the inheritance rights reform was jointly determined by a woman’s 
state of birth and year of birth. Not only did a woman have to be born in 
a state that passed the reform, she also had to be of school-going age when 
the reform was passed in her state for it to have any impact on her schooling 
decision. Given that the NFHS is a repeated cross-section, this approach 
amounts to a dii (DD) strategy over cohorts and states. 
The NFHS dataset does not contain information on an individual’s state 
of birth but it does collect data on state of residence. Hence my empirical 
analysis uses state of residence instead of state of birth. If this gives rise 
to measurement error then my estimates of the impact of inheritance rights 
my sample to those daughters who were not only themselves at least 22 years old at survey but whose mothers were also at least 44 years old at survey. 
18Of the total 18,691 women, 5,613 obtain from the 1992 round, 6,128 from the 1998 round and 6,950 from the 2005 round. Chances of double counting of individuals in successive surveys are very small since NFHS follows a two-stage cluster sampling, whereby it  samples clusters with probability proportional to population size (PPS) sampling, and then it samples households in each cluster using random sampling (IIPS, 2007). The likelihood that the same cluster is sampled is not very high. Even if the sample cluster chosen in one wave is sampled again in the next, exactly the same household is unlikely to be interviewed again as there could be upto 500 households in a single cluster out of which 20-30 are typically sampled (IIPS, 2007).

would su from attenuation bias. A bigger concern, however is that of sys- 
tematic variation in migration behaviour in response to the reform. If gender 
progressive parents marry their daughters to grooms in the reforming states 
to take advantage of the favourable laws, then too the estimates would be bi- 
ased. According to the 2001 Census of India, female inter-state migration in 
India varies between 5-10 percent, but using the Rural Economic and Demo- 
graphic Survey of 1999, I do not  any evidence of signit di in 
inter-state female migration between the reforming and non-reforming states 
in the pre-reform period. In fact, nearly 80 percent of women reside after 
marriage in the same district or other district of the same state as their 
parental household. This is also supported by the  of Rosenzweig 
and Stark (1989) that in the ICRISAT villages, the mean distance between 
a woman’s original residence place and marital place of residence is around 
30 kilometers. Hence, the possibility of systematic migration across states 
seems relatively remote in this particular context. 
The empirical analysis, as mentioned above, tests for the e of the 
reform on \treated" age cohorts. I dee the \treated" group as cohorts of 
women who were of primary school-going age when the reform was passed 
in their state. In India, children normally attend primary school between 
the ages of 5 and 10, middle school between the ages of 11 and 13 and 
high or secondary school between ages of 14 and 15. Hence, my \treated" 
group consists of cohorts of women who were 10 years or younger at the 
time of the reform since they were \young" enough for the reform to have 
a their education choices. The control group, on the other hand, would 
consist of women who were already well past school-going age by the time 
the reform was enacted in their state, i.e. were 21 years or older. The reform 
ought to have no e on their educational achievement. Thus, the basic 
16

identi strategy is a di-di between the \treated" or 
\younger" cohorts and the \control" or \older" cohorts, for reforming relative 
to non-reforming states. Such a dices estimate may be 
interpreted as the causal impact of the reform, under the assumption that in 
the absence of the reform, the change in educational attainment of women 
across cohorts would not have di systematically between the reforming 
and non-reforming states. 
However, the identi assumption should not be taken for granted. 
What if the pattern of change in female education across cohorts did vary 
systematically between the reform and non-reforming states? To address 
this concern, I test for an implication of the identifying assumption where I 
compare mean educational attainment of women who were between 16 to 20 
years old at the time of reform to that of women who were 21 or older at that 
time (control group), between reforming and non-reforming states. Since the 
former group would also have been out of school by the time the reform 
was passed in the reforming states, the change in educational attainment for 
women in this age-group relative to the control group should not, therefore, 
vary systematically across states. 
Within a regression framework, I therefore estimate the following equa- 
tion: 
eisk = s + k + sk + 1Dis;(kk 0 
 5) 
+ 2Dis;(k 0 
 10kk0 
 6) 
+3Dis;(k 0 
 15kk0 
 11) 
+ 4Dis;(k 0 
 20kk0 
 16) 
+ Xisk + isk 
(1) 
The dependent variable eisk denotes the educational attainment of woman 
i in state s belonging to cohort k (i.e. born in year k). Let the reform be 
passed in year k0 in state s. Then Dis;(kk 0 
 5) 
is a dummy indicating whether 
17 

========18========

woman i belonging to cohort k was 5 years old or younger when the reform 
was passed in her state. Similarly, Dis;(k 0 
 10kk0  6) 
is a dummy indicating whether she was between 6 and 10 years old, Dis;(k 0 
 15kk0  11) 
indicating whether she was between 11 and 15 years old and Dis;(k 0 
 20kk0  16) 
indicat- ing whether she was between 16 and 20 years old respectively. As mentioned 
earlier, the group consisting of women who were 21 years or older at the time 
of the reform constitute the omitted category. s represents state  e which accounts for state-speci characteristics that do not vary across co- 
horts, k represents cohort of birth  eect that accounts for the fact that individuals born in dit years may be exposed to dit macro shocks, 
while sk captures state-speci linear trends over cohorts. Xisk is a vector of individual-level control variables that would a education: parental age, 
parental education, land ownership, religion, number of household members 
and place of residence (urban/rural). isk is the error term. To address serial correlation concerns and to allow for heteroscedasticity, the standard errors 
are clustered at the state level (Bertrand, Du and Mullainathan, 2004). 
The coets of interest are 1 and 2, which capture the mean e on education of being exposed to the inheritance rights reform for the \treated" 
or \young" cohorts. 3 and 4, on the other hand, capture the e of the reform on older cohorts. The oldest cohort category (16 to 20 years) 
is speci included as a falsi test - the members of this cohort 
would have left school by the time the reform was passed in their state and 
hence would not be expected to experience any impact on their educational 
attainment. 
However, if there existed other unobservable factors a female ed- 
ucation that were correlated with the passage of the reform itself, then the 
identi assumption underlying the di approach 
18 

========19========

would be violated. For example, Clots-Figueras (2011)  that election of 
lower caste women leaders is positively correlated with the probability of pas- 
sage of female-friendly laws in India, of which the amendments to the HSA 
1956 would be an example. If lower caste women leaders also invest more in 
female education, then the di estimate discussed above 
could just be picking up the e of an increase in the presence of such 
women leaders in state legislatures, who were responsible for both the pas- 
sage of the reform as well as investment in female education in these states. 
State policies a female education but varying systematically between 
reforming and non-reforming states would be another example. 
To address this concern, I conduct a di 
(DDD) analysis by introducing a separate within-state-cohort control group. 
Three variants of such a control group are explored: women belonging to non- 
landed (versus landed) households, \non-Hindu" (versus \Hindu") women, 
and men (versus women). 
Thus, the expanded version of equation 1 that I estimate is: 
eisk = s + k + sk + +1Dis;(kk 0 
 5) 
+ 2Dis;(k 0 
 10kk0 
 6) 
+3Dis;(k 0

(2) 
where Ci denotes either land ownership status, \Hindu" or gender of the individual. The coets of interest are 01 and 02, which capture, e.g. in case of triple di by land ownership, the ditial impact on 
education for \treated" compared to \control" women that belong to landed 
relative to non-landed households in reforming versus non-reforming states. 
19 

========20========

The rationale behind using these groups for triple di is as fol- 
lows. Firstly, the amendment to the Hindu Succession Act 1956 would have 
a bite in the reforming states only if the parental household of the woman 
owns any joint family property to begin with. Land is the most commonly 
held form of joint family/ancestral property, hence it makes sense to ex- 
ploit variation along the dimension of land ownership status of the woman’s 
household to improve identi Now, since a household’s land owner- 
ship status obtained at the time of survey, the underlying assumption is that 
this status has remained unchanged over time. If this assumption does not 
hold in reality, then measurement error would lead to attenuation bias in the 
triple dirences estimates.19 A biggest concern, however, is that land own- 
ership status maybe correlated with the reform. The identifying assumption 
of the triple di strategy is that the di in educational out- 
comes between \treated" and \control" women belonging to landed relative 
to non-landed households in reforming states is on account of the reform. 
If, however, gender progressive parents had acquired additional land in an- 
ticipation of the reform, then this assumption would be violated. But it is 
important to note here that the reform related to ancestral property, and not 
to separate property acquired by the father in his lifetime, which allays fears 
of strategic land procurement by parents that could bias the results. 
Secondly, owing to the fact that the HSA 1956 applied ditially across 
religion in India, only women who were either Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jain 
19To elaborate on this, two possibilities could arise: one, it could be that the woman’s family did not own land when she was young but does own land now (at the time of survey) and second, the family owned land when she was young but does not now. In the  case, reform would not have had any impact on the woman’s education and including her as being landed introduces downward bias in my estimates. Moreover, the fact that the family did not own land earlier implies that the land was in most probability newly acquired and hence cannot represent ancestral property. In the second case, the reform would have had an impact on the woman’s education and excluding her also leads to downward bias. 
20 

========21========

should bene from the reform. 
Finally, since the reform to HSA 1956 relates to the issue of inheritance of 
women, men of similar age group categories may be used as a counterfactual 
to examine the impact of exposure to the reform on the gender gap in edu- 
cation. However, there may arise concerns that since change in inheritance 
rights constitute a zero-sum game within the family (more rights for daugh- 
ters implies less for sons, given a  amount of ancestral property), there 
may occur some compensating impact of the reform on men. This issue is 
discussed in further detail in section 3.2.3. 
Before proceeding to the results, I would like to point out the contribution 
of each reforming state to the cohort categories constructed above, provided 
in Table A.1. Since I focus on women who were 22 or older at the time 
of survey, the youngest cohort of women were born in 1984 (coming from 
the 2005 sample).20 Hence, the variation in Ds;(kk 0 
 5) 
primarily comes from Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, while all ve reforming states 
contribute to the variation in the remaining cohort categories. 
3 Impact on Female Education 
3.1 Di Results 
Results obtained from estimating equation 1 are presented in Table 2. With- 
out controlling for any covariates,  e or linear trends, mean ed- 
ucation of women who were 10 years or younger at reform appear to be 
signitly higher relative to the control group (column 1), although the 
coet for even those aged 11-15 at reform is quite large but statisti- 
20A small proportion of interviews in the 2005 wave were carried out in 2006, hence the youngest cohort is that of 1984 rather than 1983. 
21 

========22========

cally insignit. Adding individual level covariates and state and cohort 
of birth  e reduces the sizes of the coets for all cohort groups, 
but the results remain qualitatively similar (columns 2 and 3 respectively). 
Column 4 presents the most rigorous speci here, with the inclusion of 
state-speci linear trends by cohorts. The suggested e is that exposure 
to the reform increased mean educational attainment of the 5 or younger 
group by 0.57 years, and that of the 6-10 group by 0.5 years. This represents 
an improvement of approximately 0.02 standard deviations for both these 
\treated" groups relative to the control group. I cannot reject the equality 
of these two coets (1 and 2), but can reject (at 1 percent level) the equality of each of them to the coet for the 16-20 group (4), which is statistically insignit as well as small in magnitude. Since women in 
the 16-20 group in the reforming states were already past school-going age 
by the time the reform took place, they would not be expected to bene 
ditially in terms of education relative to the non-reforming states. This 
falsi exercise thus increases our con that the results are less 
likely to be driven by correlated unobservables, as well as allows us to rule 
out the concern that improvements in female education could have led to the 
passage of the reform in the  place (reverse causality). The coet for 
the 11-15 group (3) is much reduced and no longer statistically signit. 
The individual-level control variables have the expected signs. Focussing 
on column 4, we observe that \Hindu" women have signitly higher mean 
educational attainment compared to \non-Hindus", while parental education 
is positively correlated with education of daughters. The coet for ma- 
ternal age is also positive and highly signit, and is probably picking up 
the e of older mothers possessing greater bargaining power that may in 
turn be correlated with better child outcomes. Women belonging to landed 
22 

========23========

households21 in general have higher educational achievement, as do those 
living in urban areas. Number of household members, which is used as a 
crude proxy for number of siblings, is negatively correlated with education 
of women. 
3.2 Triple Di Results 
But as outlined earlier, these di-di estimates do not control 
for unobservable factors correlated with the passage of the reform that could 
also a female education. Hence, I turn to the triple diences approach, 
using a third source of variation within state-cohorts. 
3.2.1 Land Ownership 
Table 3 presents the results from estimating the triple di using equa- 
tion 2, where the third dimension of variation is in terms of land ownership 
status of the household the woman belongs to. Column 1 replicates the 
di result from column 4 of Table 2 for ease of reference, 
while column 2 provides the triple di result. In the latter column, 
the coets for the uninteracted cohort groups capture the impact of the 
reform on women belonging to non-landed households in the reforming states 
(the s in equation 2), while those for the cohort groups interacted with the 
variable \owns land" capture the ditial impact of the reform on women 
who belong to landed households in the reforming states (the 0s in equation 
2). Both speci control for state  e cohort of birth  
e and state-speci linear cohort trends. 
No impact is observed on the education levels of non-landed women in 
21Land ownership is also used as a proxy for income status of the household in the absence of income data in the NFHS. 
23 

========24========

any of the age groups in the reforming states, but there exists a positive and 
signit impact for those who were 5 years or younger and between 6-10 
years old at the time of the reform and belonged to landed households in these 
states. The suggested e is that being exposed to the reform increased 
mean educational attainment of women who were of primary school-going 
age at the time of reform by 0.7-0.8 years in landed relative to non-landed 
households in the reforming states, an increase of approximately 0.02 stan- 
dard deviations. No such ditial impact is observed for women who were 
16-20 years old (04) at the time of reform, thereby increasing our con in the validity of the results. Moreover, the F-test also rejects the equality of 
the coecients for 5 or younger and 16-20 groups for the landed (01 and 04) at 5 percent and that for the 6-10 and 16-20 groups (02 and 04) at 10 percent level. 
3.2.2 Hindu 
Table 4 presents the results from estimating the triple di using equa- 
tion 2, where the third dimension of variation is whether or not the woman be- 
longed to a \Hindu" family. Column 1 replicates the di 
result from column 4 of Table 2 for ease of reference, while column 2 pro- 
vides the triple di result. As in Table 3, the coets for the 
uninteracted cohort groups in column 2 capture the impact of the reform 
on \non-Hindu" women in the reforming states (the s), while those for the 
cohort groups interacted with the variable \Hindu" capture the ditial 
impact of the reform on \Hindu" women in the reforming states (the 0s). 
As in Table 3, I control for state and cohort  e but now also add 
state-religion-speci linear cohort trends to allow for the fact that \Hindus" 
and \non-Hindus" may have evolved dirently across cohorts in dit 
24 

========25========

states. 
Once again, no impact is observed on the education levels of \non-Hindu" 
women of any age group in the reforming states, and the coets are ac- 
tually all negative in sign. For the Hindu women in these states, on the other 
hand, we  a positive impact on the education level of those who were 5 
years or younger and between 6-10 years old at the time of the reform. Note 
that although the coet for the 5 or younger group is signit only 
at the 10 percent level, its magnitude is quite large. The suggested e 
is that being exposed to the reform increased mean educational attainment 
of \Hindu" women who were of primary school-going age by 1.4-1.5 years 
compared to \non-Hindu" women in reforming states, an increase of approx- 
imately 0.05 standard deviations. No such ditial impact is observed for 
women who were 16-20 years old at the time of reform. The F-test only 
barely fails to reject the equality of the coets for the 5 or younger and 
16-20 groups of \Hindus" (01 and 04) (p=0.11) but can reject the equality of the coets for the 6-10 and 16-20 groups of \Hindus" (02 and 04) at 5 percent level. 
3.2.3 Gender 
Along with the sample of women used for the above analyses, I also observe 
their brothers in the NFHS dataset, i.e. the sons of the head of the household. 
Just like in case of the women, I restrict the sample to include only those men 
who were at least 22 years of age at the time of survey. There are 70,466 such 
men in my sample, with year of birth spanning 1943 to 1984.22 For triple 
di using gender, I compare \treated" and \control" cohorts between 
women and men for reforming versus non-reforming states, and the results are 
22Of the total 70,466 men, 22,831 obtain from the 1992 round, 23,946 from the 1998 round and 23,689 from the 2005 round. 
25 

========26========

presented in Table 5. In each column, the coets for the uninteracted 
cohort groups capture the impact of the reform on men in the reforming 
states (the s), while those for the cohort groups interacted with the variable 
\daughter" capture the ditial impact of the reform on women in the 
reforming states (the 0s). 
Column 1 presents results without controlling for any  e or co- 
hort trends, while column 2 includes state  e gender-speci cohort 
of birth  e (to allow for the fact that education of girls and boys 
evolved ditially across cohorts) as well as state-speci linear cohort 
trends. Focusing on column 2, we  that the impact of the reform on the 
5 or younger group of women is positive and highly signit, while that on 
the corresponding group of men is actually negative and signit. I can 
reject the equality of these two coets (1 and 01) at the 1 percent level. The coet for the 6-10 group of women is also large but only marginally 
signit. Nonetheless, I can still reject the equality of this coet with 
the corresponding one for men (2 and 02) at the 5 percent level. In addition, both 01 and 02 are signitly dit from 04, which passes the falsi cation test. The suggested impact is that compared to men, women who 
were exposed to the reform gained approximately 1.1-1.3 additional years 
of education in the reforming states, which represents an improvement of 
approximately 0.03 standard deviations. 
The speci in column 2 uses variation in gender across households. 
Since the sample contains a lot more men than women, it is possible that 
girls and boys live in dit types of households, and the estimates are 
picking up some of these unobserved ditials that are correlated with 
education. To address this concern, I introduce household  e in 
column 3. I restrict the sample to only those households that have at least 
26 

========27========

two children, which reduces the sample size somewhat. The coet for 
the 5 or younger group of women continues to remain highly signit and 
is indeed slightly larger in magnitude compared to column 2, and I am also 
able to reject the equality of this coet with the corresponding one for 
men at the 5 percent level. The coet for the 6-10 group of women is 
also similar in magnitude and level of signi to that in column 2. It 
is also interesting to note that after controlling for household  e 
the coets for all age groups of men is positive, although statistically 
insignit, which is dit compared to what was obtained in column 2. 
This indicates that there is little evidence of any compensating behaviour on 
part of the parents towards their sons in response to the inheritance rights 
reform. 
4 Mechanism 
So far, I provide evidence that being exposed to the inheritance rights reform 
in India was associated with an increase in mean educational attainment for 
women. But what explains this e In an attempt to shed light on the 
underlying mechanism of this observed e I  examine the impact of 
exposure to the reform on the likelihood of women to inherit property. Unfor- 
tunately, the NFHS does not collect information on inheritance. Therefore, I 
use the 1999 wave of the Rural Economic and Demographic Survey (REDS),23 
which is a representative survey of households from 16 major states of India.24 
The REDS dataset is unique in that it contains retrospective information on 
23The REDS dataset is collected by the National Council of Applied Economic Research in India (NCAER). 
24The states that are excluded here but are included in NFHS are Arunachal Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Goa, Jharkhand, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, New Delhi, Sikkim and Tripura. All my education results presented earlier go through if I restrict the number of states in NFHS to match those in REDS 99. 
27 

========28========

topics like inheritance and marriage for all members of the household, in- 
cluding for daughters who have married and left the household. Here, too, 
I focus on women who are daughters of the head of the household and at 
least 22 years of age at the time of survey. Also, I restrict the sample to 
Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh and Jain women (i.e. those who were governed by the 
original HSA 1956 and thereby were a by the reform), since almost 92 
percent of the women in this sample belong to these religions. This leaves 
me with a sample size of 4,964 women. 
Using a triple di methodology with respect to land ownership, 
I analyze the impact of exposure to the inheritance reform on probability 
of inheritance by women. Inheritance typically occurs when the head of 
the family dies and the property is partitioned. Since the reform relates 
to ancestral property, the relevant event in this case is the death of the 
grandfather in the family, following which the father would become head. 
The REDS 99 dataset contains information on whether the father became 
the head of the family following the death of the grandfather or not. If for 
instance, the father set up his separate household while the grandfather was 
alive, then the question of partition of property and inheritance would be 
less relevant. Hence, I focus on only those daughters whose fathers became 
head of family following the grandfather’s death. Ideally, we would also need 
to know if the grandfather died after the reform was passed for it to have 
any bite on inheritance, but unfortunately, the REDS 99 does not contain 
this information. This remains a caveat of the analysis presented below. 
4.1 Inheritance 
For the inheritance analysis, the two \treated" groups used in the education 
analysis above have been merged to create a single \treated" group - women 
28 

========29========

who were 10 or younger at the time of reform. This is because for the group 
5 or younger, there is no variation by land ownership in the REDS 99 sample 
and hence the impact of the reform on women belonging to landed and non- 
landed households cannot be identi separately for this group. The results 
are presented in Table 6. The dependent variable is a binary variable that is 
one if the daughter inherits any land and zero otherwise. According to the 
amendment of the Hindu Succession Act (1956), unmarried women (at the 
time of the reform) were eligible to inherit ancestral property. Since the mean 
age at marriage in this sample is approximately 18 years, one would expect 
that women in the groups 10 or younger and 11-15 would display increased 
likelihood of inheritance, while those in the group 16-20 would not. 
Focusing on column 4 that controls for state and cohort  e 
as well as state-speci trends, we however  no ditial impact on 
the likelihood of inheriting land for women who were of primary school- 
going age (10 or younger) at the time of reform and belonging to landed 
households relative to non-landed ones in the reforming state. Similarly for 
women in the 11-15 group. If anything, the coets are negative, and the 
former is marginally signit. I cannot reject the equality of the coet 
estimate for the 10 or younger group for landed households with that for 
the corresponding 11-15 and 16-20 groups and for that matter, with the 
coet for the 10 or younger group for non-landed households. Hence 
it appears that daughters have continued to be disinherited from ancestral 
property, and the law did not have any impact along the dimensions it was 
intended to, at least in the short run.25 
A potential reason behind this may be related to the existence of incen- 
25This would, however, not be the  example of a gender progressive law biting the dust when it comes to practical implementation - the Dowry Prohibition Act (1961) is another law that is regularly  in practice. 
29 

========30========

tives for parents to prevent fragmentation of household property, especially 
land.26 
In India, daughters typically leave the household of their parents 
after marriage and live with their husband’s family, known as virilocality. 
This creates two problems: , parents may fear loss of control over their 
household land to the daughter’s husband’s family if the daughter is allowed 
to inherit a share. This may be further reinforced by the notion of women 
being \guests" in their natal (parental) home till they are married and that 
they really only belong to their husband’s family (Kramarae and Spender, 
2000). Hence, household land is typically passed along the male line alone so 
as to keep it within the family. Secondly, Botticini and Siow (2003) discuss 
how giving daughters equal share in household property would create disin- 
centives for sons (who have a comparative advantage in working with family 
assets compared to their married sisters) regarding provision of optimal e 
in extending family wealth, as they would no longer be able to enjoy the full 
bene of their e 
Coupled with the education results, this therefore suggests that parents 
were compensating daughters for disinheriting them from ancestral land (that 
they were now legally entitled to) by investing in their education. Quisumb- 
ing and Otsuka (2001) also  evidence of land inheritance and schooling 
being treated as dit forms of intergenerational transfers in Sumatra. 
However, such compensation would only be possible for those daughters who 
were of school-going age at the time of reform - more speci, those who 
were of primary school-going age at that time, i.e. 10 or younger. Education 
of those daughters who were already past primary school-going age, i.e. 11-15 
group, could not be improved if they had never been to school at all or had 
26In fact, fragmentation was one of the key arguments presented against extending equal rights of inheritance to joint family property for women in India in the original Hindu Succession Act of 1956 (Agarwal, 1994). 
30 

========31========

dropped out long back. For the latter group, compensation ought to take a 
dit form. One possibility could be dowry payments made at the time of 
marriage of the daughter. A number of existing studies have analyzed dowry 
as a form of \pre-mortem" bequest. Botticini and Siow (2003) in fact discuss 
how parents’ decision to give dowries to their daughters and bequests (of e.g. 
assets like land) to their sons constitute an optimal incentive scheme when 
married daughters leave the parental household after marriage while sons 
stay back and enjoy a comparative advantage in working with family assets. 
If parents seek to compensate daughters in the 11-15 group in terms of dowry 
at marriage, then we should observe dowry payments to increase for women 
belonging to this group in landed households relative to the non-landed ones 
in reforming states. 
4.2 Dowry Payments 
REDS 99 contains information on nominal dowry payments made by parents 
at the time of the daughter’s marriage. The nominal dowry payments in the 
dataset are converted to real values using the Indian Consumer Price Index 
(base: 1966 = 100).27 
Table 7 presents results for log of real dowry payments at the time of 
marriage. Focusing on column 4, we  that indeed mean dowry pay- 
ments for women in the 11-15 group increases by 0.4 percentage points for 
the land-owning households compared to the non-landed ones in reforming 
states (equality of these two coets is rejected at the 5 percent level). 
Interestingly, the mean dowry payments of the 10 or younger group declines 
27I use Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Workers as the de since the REDS dataset focuses on a rural sample. I thank Robin Burgess for generously granting me access to his Indian states data for this purpose. Also, over 90 percent of the families in my sample pay dowry and receive nothing, hence I only focus on dowry payments. 
31 

========32========

by 0.36 percentage points. This could have two potential explanations: par- 
ents choose to compensate daughters only along one dimension, so since the 
10 or younger group gains in terms of education in exchange of inheritance 
rights, they are paid less pre-mortem bequest. This explanation views educa- 
tion and dowry payments as competing channels of compensating daughters 
for disinheriting them from their rightful share in ancestral property. Al- 
ternatively, if dowry is interpreted as a price that clears marriage markets, 
then higher education could substitute for dowry payments as more educated 
brides enjoy higher valuation in the marriage market and hence has to pay 
lower dowries to secure the groom of their choice. 
In column 5, I restrict the sample to include only those daughters whose 
fathers became the head of the household following the grandfather’s death, 
in order to maintain parity with the likelihood of inheritance results presented 
in Table 6. This reduces the sample size considerably, but he results are still 
very similar to those in column 4. Although the coet for the 11-15 
group in landed households in reforming states is no longer signiant at 
conventional levels, the coet is still similar in magnitude and sign to 
that in column 4. I can also reject the equality of this coet with that 
for the non-landed in reforming states at the 10 percent level. The coet 
for the 10 or younger group continues to be negative and highly signit. 
However, the question remains as to why parents switch from dowry to 
education as a means of compensating daughters across cohorts? One po- 
tential explanation could be that although dowry is often interpreted as a 
pre-mortem bequest given to the daughter at the time of her marriage, it 
hardly remains under the control of the daughter after her marriage, and 
hence does not necessarily improve her welfare in reality (Suran, Amin, Huq, 
and Chowdhury, 2004). Education, on the contrary, is inalienable as an in- 
32

vestment in the daughter and hence may be preferred by parents as a means 
of compensation when available. However, it cannot be ruled out that par- 
ents may be responding to a scenario of changing returns to female education 
in a growing Indian economy. 
5 Conclusion 
Human capital investment is widely considered to be one of the most impor- 
tant drivers of economic growth. This is especially relevant in the case of 
women as it is well-acknowledged that greater schooling of women enhances 
the human capital of the next generation and thus makes a unique contri- 
bution to economic growth (Behrman, Foster, Rosenzweig, and Vashishtha, 
1999). This paper studies the impact of women’s property inheritance rights 
on their human capital attainment by exploiting exogenous variation gener- 
ated by state level amendments to the central inheritance law in India. I 
use a dierence-in-di approach that takes advantage of the fact that 
dit states reformed the law at dierent points in time for identication. 
In particular, I compare educational outcomes of women who were of pri- 
mary school-going age at the time of reform (exposed or \treated" group) to 
those who were too old to go to school (\control" group), between reforming 
and non-reforming states. I  that being exposed to the reform was as- 
sociated with a signit improvement in the mean educational attainment 
of women. In order to improve identi I also use a triple di 
strategy to compare the di estimate by land ownership 
status of households, religious a and gender. I  that the positive 
impact on education exists only for women (compared to men) and that too, 
only for those women belonging to landed (compared to non-landed) and 
33 

========34========

\Hindu" (compared to \non-Hindu") households. 
This paper also attempts to shed light on the underlying mechanism of 
this observed e I  that even though the reform entitled daughters 
to inherit equal shares in joint family property as sons, in reality, this did 
not happen. In other words, I  no impact of the reform on likelihood 
of inheritance by women. Instead, parents appear to be compensating their 
daughters for disinheritin them such by investing in their education as a form 
of alternative transfer of wealth. For those daughters who were already past 
school-going age at the time of the reform, the compensation takes the form 
of higher dowry at the time of their marriage. 
Thus, the  obtained in this paper have policy implications beyond 
the Indian context with regard to how socio-personal laws can act economic 
outcomes. To the extent that inequality in opportunity for women can be 
traced to legal provisions, changes in inheritance legislation have the potential 
of addressing gender imbalances and in a wide range of outcomes 
for women, with economy-wide implications. 
However, a relevant question to ask in this regard concerns the scalability 
of such amendments in order to ensure that the bene can be reaped by 
a bigger share of the population. Indeed, the amendment to the Hindu 
Succession Act 1956 as described in this paper was extended to the whole of 
India in 2005, and it will be interesting to explore if the bene enjoyed by 
the women in the  set of reforming states are subsequently shared by the 
rest of the country’s female population.
