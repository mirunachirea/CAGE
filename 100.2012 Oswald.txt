Abstract: The  question  of  whether  there  is  a  connection  between  income  and psychological well-being  is  a  long-studied issue  across  the  social,  psychological,  and behavioral  sciences. Much  research  has  found  that  richer  people  tend  to  be  happier. However, relatively little attention has been paid to whether happier individuals perform  better  financially  in  the  first  place.  This possibility of  reverse  causality  is  arguably  understudied. Using data from a large US representative panel we show that adolescents  and  young  adults  who  report  higher  life  satisfaction or positive  affect grow  up  to earn  significantly higher levels of income later in life. We focus on earnings approximately one  decade  after  the  person’s  well-being  is  measured;  we exploit  the  availability  of  sibling clusters to introduce family fixed-effects; we account for the human capacity to imagine  later  socio-economic  outcomes  and  to  anticipate  the  resulting feelings  in  current  well- being. The study’s  results are robust to the inclusion of controls such as education,  IQ,  physical health, height, self-esteem, and later happiness. We consider how psychological  well-being may  influence  income.  Sobel-Goodman  mediation  tests  reveal  direct  and  indirect effects that carry the influence from happiness to income. Significant mediating  pathways  include a  higher  probability  of obtaining  a  college  degree,  getting  hired  and  promoted, having higher degrees of optimism and extraversion, and less neuroticism.

Introduction 
The relationship between money and human happiness has generated a burgeoning cross- 
disciplinary literature. Virtually all published research on this matter has considered the  
effects  of  income upon  subjective  well-being (see  e.g. 1-9). This  study examines—and 
provides evidence  of—the  reverse.  Using  longitudinal  information  within  families  
(exploiting so-called sibling fixed-effects), it finds that happier people go on, many years 
later, to  earn  greater  incomes. The  results  are suggestive  of  some  form  of  causal  
relationship between well-being and income. 
That the  scholarly debate has mostly developed uni-directionally should probably 
not come as a surprise given that it mirrors both our societal preoccupation with economic  
development  and  the  conventional  wisdom  that  human  well-being  follows  from high  
income. The question  of  whether  “money  buys  happiness” has  not  only  dominated  the  
investigation  into  the  relationship  between  money  and  happiness, it  has  also taken  on 
increasingly causal language as  research showed positive (but marginally  diminishing) 
effects  of rising  income upon  well-being, with some differences observed  between life  
satisfaction  and  emotional  well-being (1).  However,  relatively  little  attention  has been  
paid  to  whether  happier  individuals  perform  better  financially  in  the  first  place.  This 
possibility of reverse causality is arguably understudied. 
In this study we therefore address the question of whether “happiness pays”.  We  
do so in a US representative panel of over 10,000 individuals and explore the potential 
mediating pathways running from happiness to later income. This work does not intend to  
undermine the aforementioned literature on the effect of income on well-being. Rather, the  
goal is to make the case that the relationship between income and happiness is dynamic 
and that effects may run in both directions, thus complementing existing scholarship.  
An effect running from subjective well-being to income could exist for a number of  
3 

========3========

reasons. Happiness has various correlates such as health (10), social networks (11), and  
self-esteem (12) that, in turn, are known to positively influence labor market outcomes and  
that may thus play a mediating role. More recent neuroscientific research provides clues  
that  greater subjective  well-being is  associated  with  particular  neurological variation  
which, in turn, is associated with improved cognitive skills and economic outcomes. Such  
neurological  mediation  pathways  centre  on  the  role  of  positive  emotions  (reward)  in  
stimulating the dopaminergic system and increasing cognitive capacity for memory tasks  
and attention span (13-16). These neuroscientific insights and aforementioned correlates  
provide some reason to believe that there could be an effect running from subjective well- 
being to economic outcomes. 
A handful of studies have previously tried to estimate the influence of subjective  
well-being on  later  income. Diener  et  al.  (17)  find  a  positive  correlation  between  
“cheerfulness”  measured  in  a  sample  of  elite  college  students  and  their  income  levels  
some  19  years  later.  This  association is  particularly  significant  for  those  with  below  
average levels of cheerfulness. Ed Diener and colleagues later expand on this finding to  
show that individuals who experience the highest levels of happiness do not necessarily  
perform best in terms of later income and that the “optimal” level of happiness for later 
income  appears  to  be a  moderately  high level  of  happiness (18).  Three  other  studies  
consider  the  broader  effects  of  happiness  on  life  events  including  income,  marriage,  
employment, and health (19-20), as well as consumption and savings behavior (21). The  
panel  studies  used  in  these  studies are  the British Household  Panel  Study,  Russia  
Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, German Socio-Economic Panel and the DNB Household  
Survey in the Netherlands. In a laboratory setting, Oswald, Proto, and Sgroi (22) induce 
variation in positive mood and find that it is predictive of productivity in a lab task. The 
promising  results  from  inquiries  into  the  socio-economic and  productivity effects of  
4 

========4========

happiness has led some to speak of a “happiness advantage” (23) in shaping career success  
(24) and provides further ground for why a deeper investigation is warranted.  
Although  the  aforementioned  studies are  important, because  they point  towards  a  
potential role for happiness in shaping socio-economic outcomes, they face a number of 
methodological difficulties.  First,  these studies  continue  to  leave  room  for  alternative  
explanations: cross-sectional results may be the result of genetic confounding and other  
omitted variables; longitudinal designs have so far not accounted for the human capacity  
to imagine later socio-economic outcomes and anticipate the resulting feelings in current  
well-being (25-26); and experimental designs are not in a position to evaluate longer-term  
effects  outside  the  lab.  Second,  previous  work  has  separately  considered  measures  of  
mood, happiness, life satisfaction, and mental health. The more recent literature, however,  
has  argued  that  emotional  well-being  and  satisfaction  with  life  are  two  important  yet  
different components of well-being (1). Emotional well-being refers to the frequency and  
intensity  of  everyday  emotional  experiences  (both  positive  and  negative).    The  positive  
emotions and the experience of feeling happy are commonly referred to as positive affect.  
Life  satisfaction  on  the  other  hand  refers  to  a  longer-term  evaluation  of  one’s  life.  
Although  measures  of  positive  affect and  life  satisfaction  correlate—and  load  onto  a  
common genetic  factor  (27)—they  show  varying  salience  in  different  circumstances  of  
people’s lives, including in their relationship to income and age (1, 28-29). None of the  
previous studies considered the dual effect of emotional well-being and life satisfaction on  
later income even though Kahneman and Deaton (1) conclude that the effect of income on  
positive  affect  is  less  pronounced  (and  ceases  beyond  an  annual  income  of  ~$75,000)  
compared  to  the  effect  of  income  on  life  satisfaction.  It  is  therefore  necessary  to  
investigate  whether  a  similar  distinction  can  be  made  in  the  opposite  direction,  i.e.  the  
effect  running  from  well-being  on  income.  Finally,  if  income  is  indeed  endogenous  to  
5 

========5========

happiness it becomes important to study how happiness may influence income. To address  
these  questions,  this  paper  studies  whether  life  satisfaction  and  positive  affect  are  
predictive  of  later  income—while  tackling  the  endogeneity  concerns  that  were  hitherto  
unaddressed—and investigates potential mediating pathways. 
Results 
Fig. 1  illustrates the  study’s  key result.    It plots the (uncorrected) relationship  between  
subjective  well-being and  later  earnings  in a  large US representative panel  study  (Add  
Health). Reports of positive affect or life satisfaction in adolescence and young adulthood 
correlate significantly with income around age 29 (all between r = 0.078—0.090 with p <  
0.001, see Table S2 in Supporting Information). Income here is defined in the following  
way: “Now think about your personal earnings. In {2006/2007/2008}, how much income  
did you receive from personal earnings before taxes, that is, wages or salaries, including  
tips,  bonuses,  and  overtime  pay,  and  income  from  self-employment?”    Similar to  the  
finding  on  “cheerfulness” by Diener  et  al  (17),  we  observe  that  the  relationship  is  
particularly  pronounced  for  those  individuals  with  lower levels  of  happiness.  In  fact, 
reporting a profoundly unhappy adolescence is associated with an income around age 29  
that  is  ~30%  less  than  average,  whereas a  very  happy  adolescence is associated  with  a 
later income that is ~10% above average. 
Regression analyses reported in Table 1 confirm this pattern. The predictive power  
of happiness on later earnings depends on the lag time between both variables, e.g. a one 
standard  deviation increase  in  life  satisfaction  at  the  age  of  22  is  associated  with a  5%  
increase in earnings at the age of 29 (SD = 0.81 on a scale of 5). In absolute terms, a one- 
point increase in life satisfaction at the age of 22 is associated with almost $2,000 higher  
earnings at the age of 29 (this $ value is obtained in an empirical model identical to the  
6 

========6========

one reported in Table 1 except for using income values instead of their natural logarithm).  
The  analyses  reported  here  include the  following  covariants: age,  gender,  ethnicity,  
education, IQ, physical health, height, and self-esteem (for a detailed specification of these  
variables  see Table  S1 in  SI). Most  of  these  covariates  are  standard. However,  unlike  
previous longitudinal studies of subjective well-being on later socio-economic outcomes  
and life events (17-21) the richness of the data set used here allows us to incorporate a  
measure  of  self-esteem  that  is  surveyed at  the  same  time as  positive  affect  and  life  
satisfaction. Self-esteem is a psychological construct distinct from happiness (12) and self- 
esteem is an important driver of labor market outcomes (30). As such, it is an important  
variable to control for in a study of the effect of happiness on later outcomes as not doing  
so may otherwise bias the coefficients obtained on happiness (results in Table 2 indicate  
that  self-esteem and  subjective  well-being  have  similarly  significant  effects  on  later  
earnings). Furthermore, introducing a measure of self-esteem may also allow us to control  
for feelings that anticipate happiness related to individual expectations of socio-economic  
outcomes. The  human  capacity  to  imagine  later  outcomes  and  anticipate  the  resulting  
feelings  in  current  well-being  is  well-known  (25-26).  Self-esteem  may capture  the  
confidence  one  has  in later  earnings  potential  and thus  also  account  for  the  positive  or  
negative  feelings  associated  with  the  anticipated  outcomes. Though longitudinal  studies  
allow  for  measuring subjective  well-being  prior  to  the outcome  of  interest  they  cannot  
prevent expectations about those later outcomes from being correlated with an earlier state  
of  mind and  thus  introduce  bias  into  the  earlier  measures  of  happiness. Introducing  a  
concurrent  measure  of  self-esteem  alongside  subjective  well-being  in  adolescence  and  
young  adulthood  may  therefore  also  help  account  for  anticipated feelings surrounding  
earnings potential. 
Subjective  well-being  also  has  an  important  latent  or  stable  component  that  is  
7 

========7========

considered to be contingent on genetic variation and certain personality traits (27, 31-34).  
To help distinguish variation in positive affect and life satisfaction—in adolescence and  
young adulthood—from variation in innate predispositions we also include in our analyses  
a measure of positive affect that is reported at the same time as income (around age 29).  
Doing so is important.  It allows us to capture the influence of variation in subjective well- 
being beyond the latent dimensions specific to the individual.  
Looking at Models 1—3 in Table 1, we find that positive affect in 1994 (age 16) and  
1996 (age 18), as well as life satisfaction in 2001 (age 22), each significantly predict later  
earnings (age 29). Model 4 jointly considers all these measures of subjective well-being  
over time and shows that the predictive power of variation in happiness on later income at  
those time points gradually rises as the time lag shrinks. 
The analyses reported in Table 2 go one step further.  They exploit the availability of  
sibling  clusters in  the  data to  introduce  family  fixed  effects  (for  those  individuals  
identified as twin pairs, full-siblings, half-siblings, or unrelated siblings raised together). 
The siblings’ sample is similar in demographic composition to the full Add Health sample 
(35). The structure of this data allows us to compare siblings to each other while holding  
the family environment constant (as well as a substantial portion of the genetic variation in  
most cases) which, in turn, aids our interpretation of the relationship between well-being  
and income.  
Table  2  shows that  a one standard  deviation  difference in  life  satisfaction  as  
compared to the family mean at age 22 is associated with a 6% difference in earnings as  
compared to the family mean at age 29. In absolute terms, a one-point difference in life  
satisfaction (on a scale of 5) as compared to the family mean at age 22 is associated with 
an almost $4,000 difference in earnings as compared to the family mean at age 29 (this $  
value is obtained in an empirical model identical to the one reported in Table 2 except for  
8 

========8========

using income values instead of their natural logarithm). Looking at Models 1—3 in Table  
2 we find that measures of positive affect and life satisfaction in adolescence and early  
adulthood are positively associated with later earnings. Model 4 jointly considers all these  
measures of subjective well-being over time and obtains a significant coefficient for life  
satisfaction on later income. The effect sizes of the well-being measures remain relatively 
stable between Table 1  (full  panel)  and Table 2 (sibling  panel).  The lower significance  
levels in Table 2 are presumably due to the reduced number of observations in the sibling  
panel as well as having accounted for family fixed effects. 
Tables  S7-S8 in  Supporting  Information  present  results  for  an  individual  fixed  
effects  model  and  a  Granger  causality  analysis  that  use  the  available  information  on  
earnings in 2001 (age 22). Both model specifications obtain highly significant results for  
the  effect  of  lagged  subjective  well-being  on  earnings.  However, we  do  not  lend  these  
results  full  credence  given  that  earnings  at  age  22  may  not  yet  accurately  represent  
individual income and also because these panel data allow for only one time interval and  
the exogeneity assumption necessary for panel data models is unlikely to be satisfied.   
If  income  is  indeed  endogenous  to  happiness, it  becomes  important  to  study how 
happiness  comes  to  influence a  person’s income.  Table  3  presents  results  for  our  
investigation  into potential  mediating  pathways.  These  univariate  Sobel-Goodman  
mediation tests consider potentially mediating variables that may carry some of the effect  
from  happiness  onto  income (36).  We  choose  a  number  of  standard  socio-economic  
variables as well as psychological constructs such as personality traits, optimism, and self- 
esteem. Only measures in 2008 are used—in order to reduce confounding with the earlier  
measures of subjective well-being. Table 3 shows that most of the chosen variables are  
correlated with earlier measures of positive affect and life satisfaction and also carry some  
part  of  their  influence  onto  income. The  most  significant  mediating  pathways  include  
9 

========9========

obtaining a college degree, getting hired and promoted, higher degrees of optimism and  
extraversion,  and  less  neuroticism. These variables  each  partially  mediate  the  observed  
association  with  income and may represent an indirect effect  as  large  as  approximately  
38% in the case of positive affect (around age 18) and obtaining a college degree. These  
results provide the first support for causal mechanisms running from subjective well-being  
to later income. Table S9 in SI presents the results for a multivariate mediation analysis  
that  considers  these  mediating  variables jointly.  The total  mediated  effect for  these  
variables is estimated between 68%—78% thus revealing an important combined indirect  
effect, in addition to a direct effect, that carries the influence from happiness to income. 
These results suggest a relationship that is pleiotropic in nature with psychological well- 
being having an independent effect on both income and the mediating variables. 
Discussion 
This study reverses one  of  the famous  questions of  social  science. It  is  an  attempt  to  
explore  the  influence  not  of  income  upon  well-being  but  instead  of  well-being  upon  
income.    As Figure 1 illustrates, the linkages are estimated to be long and the empirical  
consequences large.    
The  paper’s  contribution is partly  substantive  and  partly methodological.    By  the  
nature of its data, the study is able to introduce sibling-fixed effects to account for much  
potential  omitted-variable  bias  (family-related  covariates, including  a significant  part  of  
genetic endowment). Compared with individual fixed-effects, sibling fixed-effects allows  
for making inferences about the lagged effects of well-being at particular time points (such  
as adolescence and young adulthood) instead of having to consider variation between time  
intervals.  This  work  also  applies mediation  analysis,  and may thus help  to  uncover the 
10 

========10========

mechanisms  running  from  well-being  to  later  income.  The  most  significant  mediating  
pathways  include  obtaining  a  college  degree,  getting  hired  and  promoted,  and  having  
higher  degrees  of  optimism  and  extraversion,  and  less  neuroticism.  Including current  
happiness in this longitudinal study allows us to better control for variation in latent well- 
being predisposition. This enables an examination of the consequences of variation in life  
satisfaction and positive affect at adolescence and young adulthood above-and-beyond any  
variation  in  the  stable  component of  well-being.  The  use  of a  large  US  representative  
panel on this question also distinguishes this research from prior work that looked at the  
economic  benefits  of  psychological  well-being,  as  does offering a  joint  analysis  of  life  
satisfaction  and  positive  affect.  Finally, the  study is  the  first attempt to  account for a  
person’s “anticipated happiness” in this kind of longitudinal analysis (through its use of 
proxy measures of current self-esteem). This should help to prevent a person’s conscious  
or  subconcious expectations  about their future earnings  from  introducing  bias  into the 
estimate of the consequences of current psychological well-being.  
For researchers who study human well-being, the message of the paper is that well- 
being  regression  equations  cannot  be  expected  to  be  estimated  in  a  reliable  way  unless  
allowance is made for the endogeneity of income. This study also points to long time-lags  
between  psychological  well-being  in  year  T  and  people’s  incomes  in  year  T+10  and  
beyond.    Greater knowledge of the underlying causes of these remarkable lags, and their  
reach in  social  and  economic  processes,  will  be  needed. Research  that  considers  the  
potential benefits of variation in life satisfaction or positive affect is part of a fairly new  
avenue in  the  study  of  human  well-being. Although  most research  in  this  literature  has  
studied  the  determinants  of  happiness, recently  has  there  been  growing  interest  in  the  
broader benefits that happiness may induce (10, 29, 37).  For policy-makers, the existence  
of  these  mechanisms raises the possibility  that a  happier  society  may be one that 
11 

========11========

intrinsically generates  higher  incomes  for  its  citizens. Traditional  thinking has  focused  
upon the opposite. 
Although human well-being is considered instrumentalist in this paper or as a means— 
rather  than  an  end  in  itself—it  needs  to  be  emphasized  that  this  is  not with  a  view  to  
putting  money  centre-stage  at  the  expense  of  happiness.  To  the  contrary,  the  results  
indicate  that  happiness  and  income  are  connected  by  a  two-way  relationship,  and  that  
human well-being can itself be a source of economic dynamism. 
Materials and Methods 
Data  is  from  the restricted-use National  Longitudinal  Study  of  Adolescent  Health (Add  
Health) sample available by contractual agreement (38). Add Health was started in 1994 in  
order  to  explore  the  health-related  behavior  of  adolescents  in  grades  7  through  12.  By  
now, 4 waves of data collection have taken place and participating subjects were around  
30  years old in Wave  IV (2008).  The first wave of the Add Health study (1994-1995)  
selected  80  high  schools  from  a  sampling  frame  of  26,666 schools.    The  schools  were  
selected based on their size, school type, census region, level of urbanization, and percent  
of the population that was white. Participating high schools were asked to identify junior  
high or middle schools that served as feeder schools to their school. This resulted in the  
participation  of  145  middle, junior  high,  and  high  schools. From  those  schools,  90,118  
students completed a 45-minute questionnaire and each school was asked to complete at  
least  one  School  Administrator  questionnaire.  This  process  generated  descriptive  
information about each student, the educational setting, and the environment of the school.   
From these respondents, a core random sample of adolescents in grades 7-12 were drawn  
plus  several  over-samples, bringing  the total for  Wave  I to  20,745 adolescents.  These  
students  and  their  parents  were  administered in-home  surveys.  Wave  II  (1996)  was  
12 

========12========

comprised  of  another  set  of  in-home  interviews  of  14,738  students  from  the  Wave  I  
sample.    Wave  III  (2001-2002)  consisted  of  an  in-home  interview  of  15,197 Wave  I  
participants.  Finally, Wave IV (2008) consisted of an in-home interview of 15,701 Wave  
I  participants.  The  result  of  this  sampling  design  is  that  Add  Health  is  a  nationally  
representative study.  Women make up 49% of the study's participants, Hispanics 12%,  
Blacks  16%,  Asians  3%,  and  Native  Americans  2%.    Participants  in  Add  Health  also  
represent all regions of the United States. 
In Wave I of the Add Health study, researchers screened for sibling pairs including  
all adolescents that were identified as twin pairs, full-siblings, half-siblings, or unrelated  
siblings raised together. The sibling-pairs sample is similar in demographic composition to  
the  full  Add  Health  sample (35). Consequently,  in  all  regression  models  we  cluster  the  
standard errors of our estimates in order to better account for the fact that a subset of our  
observations  is not  independent.  The  structure  of  this  data  also  allows  us  to  compare  
siblings  to  each  other  while  holding  the  family  environment  constant,  which  aids  our  
interpretation of the relationship between well-being, childhood context, and income as an  
adult.  
In  all  four  interview  waves  of  Add  Health  the  subjects  were  asked  about  their  
subjective well-being. In particular, in waves I and II, the positive affect sub-scale of the  
CES-D index (39) was administered. The CES-D index asks how often certain statements  
were true during the last week. The positive affect sub-scale is additively composed of the  
responses  to  the  following  four  particular  statements:  “You  enjoyed  life”,  “You  were  
happy”, “You felt hopeful about the future”, and “You felt that you were just as good as  
other people.” The detailed question and answer structure for the four questions that make  
up  this  positive  affect  scale  are  given  in  Supporting  Information  (Table  S1).  The  life  
satisfaction  question  was  surveyed  in  wave  III  only  and  asked:  “How  satisfied  are  you  
13 

========13========

with your life as a whole?” Income in wave IV was reported as personal earnings before  
taxes and the mean income in the Add Health sample was approximately $35,000. The  
measure  for  self-esteem  was  derived  from  the  answer  to  “Compared  with  other  people  
your age, how intelligent are you?” which was surveyed in all interview waves. Precise 
variable descriptions and descriptive statistics, as well as distribution scales for the well- 
being  measures,  are  given  in  Table  S1 for  all  variables  employed  in  this  paper.  A  
correlation matrix for the well-being measures across all interview waves and income in 
wave IV is also given in SI (Table S2).  
The  analyses  are  run  using  linear  regression  models  with  clustering  on  standard  
errors in order to better account for the fact that a subset of the Add Health observations  
are  not  independent.  We  also  leverage  the  sibling  clusters  in  the  Add  Health  data  by  
introducing  family  fixed  effects  (Table  2).  The  empirical  framework  here  follows  a  
standard  specification  where  income  (in  2008)  is  regressed  on  earlier  subjective  well- 
being measures and a set of other characteristics. With family fixed effects the empirical  
model takes the following form: 
Yij = β0 + β1(SWBij) + βk(Zkij) + μj + εij 
where i and j index individual and family respectively and Yij is earnings. Zk is a matrix  
comprised of variables that may differ between siblings (gender, age, height, self-esteem,  
etc.). To control for common family attributes family fixed effects are introduced (μj) and  
εij represents an individual-specific error. Such family fixed effect analyses are equivalent  
to differencing all equation variables within sibling pairs in order to account for family- 
related  unobservables.  For  a  discussion  of  assumptions  involved  see Griliches  (40) and  
more recent surveys. As compared to individual fixed effect panel studies, the advantage  
of  a  family  fixed  effects  model  is that  it  allows  for  the  study  of longer-term  effects  of  
subjective  well-being  at a  particular  time  period,  here  in adolescence  and  young

To  test  for  mediation  we  employ  the  Sobel-Goodman  method available  in  the  
STATA package that follows the logic described in Baron and Kenny (35). A variable is  
considered  a  mediator  (M)  if  it  carries  some  part  of  the  effect  from  an  independent  
variable (X), here positive affect and life satisfaction, onto a dependent variable (Y), in  
our  case  later  earnings.  Mediation  occurs  if  (i)  X  significantly  predicts  M;  (ii)  X  
significantly predicts Y in the absence of M; (iii) M significantly predicts Y controlling for  
X; and (iv) the effect of X on Y shrinks upon addition of M. Description and references  
for the multivariate mediation test are provided in SI (Table S9).

Fig 1. The longitudinal relationship between subjective well-being (at ages 16, 18, and 22) and later earnings (at age 29). 
Response categories for positive affect (at ages 16 and 18) and life satisfaction (at age 22)  are  presented in  relationship  with  their  respective  mean  income  levels  at  about  age  29.  Mean income across the sample is $34,632 at age 29. N equals 14,867 for positive affect  at  age  16,  N  equals  11,253  for  positive  affect  at  age  18,  and  N  equals  12,415  for  life  satisfaction at age 22. The original positive affect variable categories are reshaped to a 5- point scale for ease of comparison. Error bars (2 standard errors) are shown.

Table S7. Individual fixed-effects models of log income on lagged subjective well-being  and covariates. 
Note  that  this time  series only covers 2 time periods for  which  earnings  are  available  (2001  and  2008).  Subjective  well-being  variables  are  transformed  into  5-point  scales.

Table S8. Granger causality tests. 
Granger causality tests analyze whether lagged observations of income (2001) and life  satisfaction (2001) have incremental forecasting power when added to a univariate  autoregressive representation of income (2008) and positive affect (2008). 
Table S9. Multivariate mediation test on log income (2008). 
Multivariate mediation tests for multiple potentially mediating variables (MV) considered  jointly. These variables may carry the effect from lagged positive affect or life satisfaction (IV) to later earnings (DV). Presented are the mediation test coefficient, p-value, and the  proportion of the total effect that is mediated (%). All variable coefficients are  
standardized. The mediated (indirect) effect is tabulated using the product of the  coefficients method that multiplies the regression coefficients from the IV on MV and MV  on DV regressions. These sets of coefficients and their standard errors are obtained using  “seemingly unrelated regression” (sureg in Stata). The mediated effect is obtained by  multiplying the coefficients using the “non-linear combination” command (nlcom in Stata)  and these single mediated effects are considered additively when tabulating the total  indirect or mediated effect (also using nlcom in Stata). For a detailed description and  example please see http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/faq/mulmediation.htm
