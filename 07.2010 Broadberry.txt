Abstract: This paper provides estimates of Indian GDP constructed from the output side for the period 1600-1871, and combines them with population estimates to track changes in living standards. Indian per capita GDP declined steadily. As British living standards increased from the mid-seventeenth century, India fell increasingly behind. Whereas in 1650, Indian per capita GDP was more than 80 per cent of the British level, by 1871 it had fallen to less than 15 per cent. As well as placing the origins of the Great Divergence firmly in the early modern period, these estimates suggest a relatively prosperous India at the height of the Mughal Empire, with living standards well above bare bones subsistence.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Recently, there has been much progress in reconstructing the historical national 
accounts of a number of European countries during the early modern and even the late 
medieval periods (Blomme and van der Wee, 1994; Malanima, 2003; Krantz, 2004; 
Álvarez-Nogal and Prados de la Escosura, 2007; Broadberry et al., 2009; van 
Leeuwen and van Zanden, 2009). This paper applies similar methods to Asia, 
providing estimates of Indian GDP for the period before 1870. There is a strong need 
for estimates of Indian GDP during the early colonial period, to assess the strong 
revisionist claims about Indian economic performance made recently in the context of 
the Great Divergence debate. Parthasarathi (1998) has made the most striking claims 
for south India during the eighteenth century, arguing that living standards were just 
as high as in Britain, while Bayly (1983) has painted a picture of a thriving north 
Indian economy during the eighteenth century. 
This paper presents estimates of GDP constructed from the output side for the 
pre-1871 period, and combines them with population data. We find that Indian per 
capita GDP declined steadily between 1600 and 1871. As British living standards 
increased from the mid-seventeenth century, India fell increasingly behind. Whereas 
in 1650, Indian per capita GDP was more than 80 per cent of the British level, by 
1871 it had fallen to less than 15 per cent. These estimates support the claims of 
Broadberry and Gupta (2006), based on wage and price data, that the Great 
Divergence had already begun during the early modern period. They are also 
consistent with a relatively prosperous India at the height of the Mughal Empire, 
although much of this prosperity had disappeared by the eighteenth century. 
Projecting back from Maddison’s (2003) widely accepted estimates of GDP per capita 
2 

========3========

for the late nineteenth century in 1990 international dollars, we arrive at a per capita 
income in 1600 of $782, well above the bare bones subsistence level of $400, or a 
little over a dollar a day. This is more in line with the recent revisionist work on 
Europe, which suggests that Maddison (2003) has substantially underestimated living 
standards in the pre-modern world (Broadberry et al., 2009). 
The paper proceeds as follows. We begin in Section II with a brief survey of 
the existing literature on India’s long run economic performance. This is followed in 
Section III by an overview of methods, drawing on previous work reconstructing 
national income in Britain and Europe before 1800. Section IV then applies those 
methods to India, describing the procedures for estimating output in agriculture, 
industry and services, before aggregating the sectoral outputs into real GDP for India 
during the period 1600-1871. In Section V, these GDP estimates are then combined 
with data on population to derive estimates of Indian GDP per capita, and used to 
compare living standards in India and Britain. Section V concludes. 
III. INDIA’S LONG RUN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 
India’s economic performance since the late sixteenth century has been the subject of 
enduring controversy. The travelogues of Europeans to India in the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries often described great wealth and opulence, but it is not difficult 
to see this as reflecting their contact with the ruling classes, who enjoyed a luxurious 
lifestyle with consumption of high quality food, clothing and ornaments, as well as 
imported luxury products. The middle class merchants and rich peasants that 
European travellers most frequently came into contact with also enjoyed a 
comfortable life-style. However, most travel accounts of Mughal India and the 
3 

========4========

Deccan also noted that the majority of Indians lived in poverty (Chandra, 1982; 
Fukazawa, 1982). The labouring classes were seen as living in mud huts with thatched 
roofs, eating inferior grains, wearing rudimentary clothing and the use of footwear 
was relatively unknown (Moreland, 1923: 197-203). While cultural and climatic 
conditions may explain some of the consumption differences between India and 
Europe, most writers were in little doubt that the average Indian lived in poverty. 
Furthermore, there is a substantial literature which attempts to chart trends in 
Indian living standards over time, starting from 1595. The reign of Akbar is usually 
seen as the peak of economic well being, and is well documented in Abū ’l-Fazl’s 
[1595] Ā’ īn–i-Akbarī, which meticulously reported wages and prices in the region of 
Agra. This has provided a reference point for real wage comparisons with later years. 
Desai (1972) made the striking claim that at best, the average standard of living in 
1961 was no higher than in 1595, when although a labourer could afford less 
industrial goods such as clothing, he could buy more food, with the changing relative 
prices reflecting the changing productivity trends in agriculture and industry. The 
paper provoked some controversy over the details of the calculations (Heston, 1977; 
Moosvi, 1977; Desai, 1978). Nevertheless, most writers seem to accept the idea of a 
downward real wage trend during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries before 
recovery during the twentieth century, a pattern first suggested by Mukerjee (1967) 
and confirmed recently by Broadberry and Gupta (2006). 
This view of Mughal India as a relatively backward economy has been 
challenged recently by the work of revisionist economic historians, whose work must 
be assessed within the wider context of changing views on the Great Divergence of 
4 

========5========

living standards between Asia and Europe. Parthasarathi’s (1998) characterisation of 
south Indian real wages as on a par with English real wages in during the eighteenth 
century is at variance with the older literature, but fits well with the claims of 
Pomeranz (2000), Frank (1998) and other world historians that the most developed 
parts of Asia were on the same development level as the most developed parts of 
Europe such as Britain and the Netherlands as late as 1800. Bayly (1983) has painted 
a picture of a thriving market economy in north India during the eighteenth century, 
which leaves a similar impression. 
Broadberry and Gupta (2006) compare silver and grain wages in Britain with 
those in India and China during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which casts 
doubt on the revisionist position, suggesting that the Great Divergence was already 
under way during the early modern period. However, a full assessment, encompassing 
the ruling elites and middles classes as well as the labouring classes, requires the 
reconstruction of national income in European and Asian countries. This paper makes 
a start on that process by deriving estimates of GDP and population in India between 
1600 and 1870, and comparing GDP per capita between India and Britain. This is the 
first time series of national income estimates for India before the mid-nineteenth 
century, which can be seen as joining up with Heston’s (1983) estimates for the 
period after 1870. Our comparative results are also broadly consistent with Roy’s 
(2010) finding that GDP per capita in Bengal was substantially lower than in England 
and Wales during the second half of the eighteenth century. 
III. AN OVERVIEW OF METHODS 
5 

========6========

The first phase of historical national accounting focused on reconstructing national 
income for a small number of relatively rich countries in Western Europe and North 
America, and starting around 1870, at the beginning of the modern statistical age 
(Kuznets, 1946; Clark, 1957; Maddison, 1982). A natural development was the 
application of this approach to other parts of the globe, and many non-western 
countries now have historical national accounts reaching back to around 1870 
(Maddison, 1995). For the period before 1870, there has now been a substantial period 
of experimentation, beginning with the study of British economic growth back to 
1688 by Deane and Cole (1967). 
Deane and Cole’s (1967) study was remarkable for the way in which the 
authors made efficient use of the limited range of processed data series that were 
available at the time. Subsequent research by many authors has dramatically extended 
the range of data now available, with the revised estimates of Crafts and Harley 
(1992) proving an important staging post. Broadberry and van Leeuwen (2008) have 
now succeeded in producing annual estimates of GDP for Great Britain over the 
period 1700-1850. Furthermore, Broadberry et al. (2009) have extended the approach 
back to 1300 for the territory of England. 
Deane and Cole’s (1967) approach now seems remarkably simple in the light 
of the vast amount of subsequent research. Nevertheless, its simplicity and modest 
demands on data makes it particularly suitable as a starting point for Asian historical 
national accounting in the period before the wide availability of official statistics at a 
national level. We focus here on Deane and Cole’s (1967) method for the eighteenth 
century, where they constructed an index of total real output, based on industry, 
6 

========7========

agriculture and services. Their estimates are reproduced here in Table 1. The sector 
that was most firmly grounded in the data was industry. For the export industries, 
such as cotton, output was assumed to grow in line with exports, for which abundant 
data were available. For home industry, production was assumed to move in line with 
the physical quantities of output of leather, beer, candles and soap. Finally, since 
Deane and Cole had no independent data on commerce, the index of industrial output 
was assumed to apply also to the commercial sector. It is not much of an 
exaggeration, therefore, to say that the whole of the industrial and commercial sector 
was dependent on the export data. 
For agriculture and services, by contrast, the key data series was population. 
For agriculture, an index of production was derived by assuming that agricultural 
demand grew in line with population, which amounted to assuming constant per 
capita corn consumption. An adjustment was then made for known imports and 
exports of grain, to convert demand to domestic production. For services, even in 
modern national accounts it is not uncommon to assume that real output moves in line 
with employment. Since for the eighteenth century Deane and Cole had only 
fragmentary evidence on employment, they assumed that service output grew in line 
with population. For the government sector, however, it was possible to obtain direct 
estimates of output from government budget sources. Finally, to combine the 
individual series into an index of GDP, it was necessary to find appropriate weights 
for agriculture, industry and services. These were taken from Gregory King’s [1696] 
social tables, and are given at the top of each column in Table 1. 
7 

========8========

It should by now be clear that Deane and Cole’s (1967) estimates of British 
GDP in the eighteenth century are overwhelmingly dependent on the path of 
population and exports, with a minor role for government expenditure and a restricted 
set of volume indicators for home industry. It would not be difficult to assemble a 
similar data set for India between 1600 and 1871, and that is what we proceed to do in 
the next section. However, we will not stop there, because work conducted since 
Deane and Cole’s (1967) study suggests a number of ways of improving upon this 
approach, and again in ways which can be replicated with the data available for India. 
First, subsequent work on the agricultural sector has allowed for a more 
sophisticated treatment of demand. Crafts (1976) criticised Deane and Cole’s 
assumption of constant per capita corn consumption while real incomes were rising 
and the relative price of corn was changing, and Crafts (1985) recalculated the path of 
agricultural output in Britain with income and price elasticities derived from the 
experience of later developing countries. The approach was developed further by 
Allen (2000) using consumer theory. Allen (2000: 13-14) starts with the identity: 
a 
 cNrq 
(1) 
where qa is agricultural output, r is the ratio of production to consumption, c is 
consumption per head and N is population. Agricultural consumption per head is 
assumed to be a function of its own price (pa), the general consumer price level (pc), 
and income (y). Assuming a log-linear specification, we have: 
 
 
210 
ca 
  lnlnlnln yppc (2) 
where α1 and α2 are the own-price and cross-price elasticities of demand, β is the 
income elasticity of demand and α0 is a constant. Consumer theory requires that the 
own-price, cross-price and income elasticities should sum to zero, which sets tight 
8 

========9========

constraints on the plausible values, particularly given the accumulated evidence on 
elasticities in developing countries (Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980: 15-16, 60-82). For 
early modern Europe, Allen (2000: 14) works with an own-price elasticity of -0.6 and 
a cross-price elasticity of 0.1, which constrains the income elasticity to be 0.5. 
Second, a number of authors have used the share of the population living in 
towns as a measure of the growth of the non-agricultural sector. This approach began 
with Wrigley (1985), and has recently been combined with the demand approach to 
agriculture to provide indirect estimates of GDP in a number of European countries 
during the early modern period (Malanima, 2003; Álvarez-Nogal and Prados de la 
Escosura, 2007; Pfister, 2008). With the path of agricultural output (qa) derived using 
equations (1) and (2), overall output (q) is derived as: 
q 
 
q 
a 
 
na 
/1 qq  
(3) 
where the share of non-agricultural output in total output (qna/q) is proxied by the 
urbanisation rate. The approach can be made less crude by adjusting the urbanisation 
rate to deal with rural industry or agricultural workers living in towns. 
IV. ESTIMATING INDIAN NATIONAL INCOME 
In this section we derive estimates of Indian GDP by sector, following the basic 
approach of Deane and Cole (1967), but incorporating demand effects into agriculture 
and urbanisation effects into services. 
1. Population 
The first full census of India was conducted non-synchronously between 1867 and 
1872, but is usually presented as the first decennial census for 1871. For the period 
9 

========10========

1801-1871, we use the decadal estimates of Mahalanobis and Bhattacharya (1976), 
who assembled information collected by the British for the three Presidencies of 
Bengal, Madras and Bombay, and supplemented this with assumptions about the rate 
of population growth in the non-enumerated regions. For earlier years, we have drawn 
on the estimates collected together by Visaria and Visaria (1983: 466), based on a 50- 
year frequency. We use the Bhattacharya estimates for 1751-1801, the mean Datta 
estimates to link 1600 and 1750, the Wilcox estimates to link 1600 with 1650, and 
log-linear interpolation for 1700. 
Given the hybrid nature of the series projected back from the 1871 benchmark, 
it is worth noting that Habib (1982: 164-166) provides a useful cross-check for the 
absolute population level in 1600, on the basis of three alternative methods of 
estimation. One approach, based on the cultivated area, yields an estimate of 142 
million, while an alternative approach based on land revenue suggests a population of 
144.3 million. A third method, based on the size of armies, suggests a population of 
140 to 150 million. All three estimates are broadly consistent with our population 
figure of 142 million in 1600. 
2. Agricultural output 
The simplest procedure for estimating an index of agricultural output is to follow 
Deane and Cole’s (1967) assumption of constant per capita grain consumption in 
deriving domestic demand. This is also the approach used by Wrigley (1985) for pre- 
industrial Europe. However, Deane and Cole also made an allowance for net exports 
of grain, and in the case of India, we shall need to allow for net exports of agricultural 
crops, particularly during the nineteenth century as exports of cotton cloth declined. 
10 

========11========

Focusing initially on domestic demand, our first index of domestic agricultural 
production is simply the index of the population level. Following Crafts (1985) and 
Allen (2000), however, it is desirable to allow for consumer response to changing real 
incomes. Table 3 thus sets out an index of real wages for unskilled labourers in India, 
derived from Broadberry and Gupta (2006) for the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries, supplemented by additional information for the nineteenth century from 
Mukerjee (1967). Although the precise magnitude of the fall in the real wage from its 
high level in the early seventeenth century is a matter of controversy, most scholars 
have acknowledged the downward trend (Desai, 1972; 1978; Moosvi, 1973; 1977; 
Heston, 1977). Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the scale of the Indian real 
wage decline is similar to that suggested by Allen (2001) for early modern southern 
and eastern Europe, where a long period of decline steadily eroded the post-Black 
Death doubling of real wages. 
Indices of domestic agricultural production are provided in Table 4A. The first 
index is based on the assumption of constant per capita grain consumption, while the 
second series is derived from the demand model with an income elasticity of demand 
of 0.5. Whereas the constant per capita grain consumption model suggests a 
substantial growth of agricultural output with the expansion of the population, the 
demand model suggests an agricultural sector that was struggling to maintain output 
at its Mughal peak until well into the nineteenth century. 
Turning to the impact of foreign trade, Table 4b provides an index of 
agricultural exports. This is derived by obtaining the value of total exports in current 
11 

========12========

prices and the share of agricultural crops from Chaudhuri (1983), and deflating the 
resulting series of agricultural exports in current prices by an agricultural price index 
from Mukerjee (1967). For the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, we have 
assumed that agricultural exports grew in line with domestic agricultural production. 
Weights for the export and domestic components of agricultural production in 1871 
are obtained by projecting the share of exports in total production in 1901 back in 
time. Although the share of exports in total agricultural production in 1871 was only 
around 10 per cent, agricultural exports nevertheless had a significant impact on the 
path of total agricultural production in the nineteenth century, as exports of crops such 
as raw cotton, opium and indigo offset the decline in exports of cotton piece goods. 
3. Industrial Output 
Table 5 sets out the data for estimating the output of industry oriented towards the 
home market. Before the nineteenth century, this moved in line with population, as 
the result of an assumed constancy of per capita consumption of cloth at 8.41 square 
yards per head, derived from Prakash (1976: 174) for the early eighteenth century, 
and consistent with the level suggested for the late nineteenth century by Ellison 
[1886: 63]. Nevertheless, domestic production did not move simply in line with 
population after 1801 because of the growing penetration of the Indian home market 
by imports from Britain. 
For export industry, it is possible to track Indian textile exports to Britain for 
the period 1665-1834 from Chaudhuri (1978) and Bowen (2007). The data are set out 
in Table 6 and Figure 1. Although we lack data for Indian exports to other countries, it 
is possible to make an allowance for the growing share of Britain as an export 
12 

========13========

destination using data on regional shares of bullion inflows to India from Haider 
(1996: 323), since the purchase of Indian textiles was financed largely with silver. 
The data in Figure 1 capture the healthy state of the Indian cotton textile export 
industry during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. After 1801, however, the 
industry went into decline, particularly with the growing British competition after the 
end of the Napoleonic Wars (Broadberry and Gupta, 2009a). Table 7 charts the 
continued decline of the Indian textile export industry until the establishment of a 
modern factory based industry in Bombay during the 1850s (Morris, 1983: 572-583; 
Farnie, 2004: 400-405). The current price data for the period 1851-1871 have been 
converted to constant prices using an index of imported cotton cloth prices from 
Sandberg (1974: 260), which tracks well the price of domestically produced cloth for 
overlapping years from Mitra (1978: 207). During this period, the price of cloth rose 
by just 6.3 per cent, so the deflation makes only a small difference to the nominal 
data. 
Putting together the trends in home industries and export industries, it is clear 
that there was an absolute decline in industrial production in nineteenth century India, 
rather than just a reduction of the share of industry in economic activity, consistent 
with Clingingsmith and Williamson’s (2008) definition of strong rather than weak 
deindustrialisation. Nevertheless, the scale of Indian deindustrialisation shown here is 
in line with that suggested by Twomey (1983) rather than the more catastrophic 
domestic industrial collapse claimed by Bagchi (1976) on the basis of evidence from 
the state of Bihar. 
4. The service sector 
13 

========14========

For domestic services and housing, Deane and Cole (1967) assumed growth in line 
with population. However, recent work on the long run development of the European 
economy suggests that service sector growth moves more closely in line with the 
urban population (Broadberry et al., 2009). Estimates of the urban share of the 
population in India are presented in Table 8 for benchmark years, suggesting a decline 
in the share of the population living in cities of more than 5,000 inhabitants. 
Multiplying the population by the urban share, with interpolation between benchmark 
years, yields an estimate of the urban population, which remained fairly stable despite 
the growing total population. 
5. Sectoral shares 
To aggregate the time series for output in each of the major sectors into a total real 
output index, we require value added weights. The earliest sectoral value added 
weights for India are for 1900/01 from the work of Sivasubramonian (2000). 
However, these can be projected back to circa 1871 using changes in employment 
structure, following the procedure used by Hoffmann (1965: 389) for Germany. 
Essentially, this involves assuming that the sectoral distribution of value added per 
employee in 1900/01 acts as a good indicator of the sectoral distribution of value 
added per employee in 1871. 
The sectoral weights for India circa 1871 are set out in Table 9. The largest 
sector was agriculture, and industry was largely geared towards the domestic market. 
Commerce accounted for 5.5 per cent of GDP, but is combined here with industry. 
Government, domestic services and housing together accounted for the remaining 
10.3 per cent of GDP. 
14 

========15========

6. Total real output 
Table 10 sets out the time series for all the major sectors and the aggregate output or 
gross domestic product (GDP) index obtained using the 1871 sectoral weights from 
Table 9. Industry and commerce grew rapidly during the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries, in contrast to the stagnation in agriculture. Since agriculture was the largest 
sector, the growth of total output was therefore quite modest before 1801. During the 
nineteenth century, although agriculture began to grow, this was offset by 
developments in industry and commerce, where there was a severe loss of export 
markets and penetration of the Indian home market by cotton textile imports from 
Britain, so that total output stagnated. 
V. PER CAPITA GDP 
The GDP series from Table 10 can be combined with the population data from Table 
2 to establish in Table 11 the path of GDP per capita in India. Per capita GDP 
declined fairly steadily between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. Table 12 
puts India’s per capita GDP performance in an international comparative perspective. 
Benchmarking on the comparative India/GB per capita GDP level for 1871 from 
Broadberry and Gupta (2009b), we see that India’s comparative position deteriorated 
sharply from a position of more than 80 per cent of the British level in 1650 to just 
14.5 per cent by 1871. The relative decline occurred fairly steadily from the mid- 
seventeenth century. 
Table 13 converts the GDP per capita information in index number form from 
Table 12 into absolute levels of 1990 international dollars, as has become standard 
15 

========16========

since the work of Maddison (1995). This enables us to gauge how far above bare 
bones subsistence India was. The World Bank’s “dollar-a-day” definition of poverty 
suggests a per capita income level of around $400 as a minimum, and Maddison 
(1995) finds a number of third world countries at this level in the modern world. Note, 
however, that Mughal India was well above this level, and even after the decline of 
the seventeenth century, per capita incomes remained between 650 and 750 dollars for 
most of the eighteenth century. It was only during the nineteenth century that Indian 
per capita incomes fell close to bare bones subsistence. 
Tables 12 and 13 have important implications for the debate over the Great 
Divergence. First, Parthasarathi (1998) uses a comparative real wage study of Britain 
and India to support the “California School” view that living standards in the most 
developed parts of Asia were on a par with the most developed parts of Europe as late 
as the end of the eighteenth century (Frank, 1998; Pomeranz, 2000). The evidence 
presented in Table 12, however, suggests that Indian living standards were already 
substantially below the British level during the seventeenth century. This supports the 
view of Broadberry and Gupta (2006) that the Great Divergence was already well 
underway during the early modern period. 
Second, although Table 13 provides evidence of a prosperous India at the 
height of the Mughal Empire at the time of Akbar, much of this prosperity had 
disappeared by the eighteenth century. However, it is only with further decline during 
the nineteenth century that most Indians were reduced to what Allen (2009) calls 
“bare bones” subsistence. With per capita incomes of between 650 and 750 
international dollars in 1990 prices, eighteenth century India was still sufficiently 
16 

========17========

prosperous to be consistent with the scale of market activity described by Bayly 
(1983). 
VI. CONCLUDING COMMENTS 
This paper provides estimates of Indian GDP constructed from the output side for the 
pre-1871 period, and combines them with population estimates to track the path of 
living standards. Indian per capita GDP declined steadily between 1600 and 1871. As 
British living standards increased from the mid-seventeenth century, India fell 
increasingly behind. Whereas in 1650, Indian per capita GDP was more than 80 per 
cent of the British level, by 1871 it had fallen to less than 15 per cent. 
These estimates cast further doubt on the extent of the recent revisionist work 
which seeks to date the origins of the Great Divergence of living standards between 
Europe and Asia only after the Industrial Revolution (Frank, 1998; Parthasarathi, 
1998; Pomeranz, 2000). The GDP per capita data, as well as the wage and price data 
surveyed by Broadberry and Gupta (2006), suggest strongly that the Great Divergence 
had already begun during the early modern period. They are also consistent with a 
relatively prosperous India at the height of the Mughal Empire, although much of this 
prosperity had disappeared by the eighteenth century. Nevertheless, India sank close 
to the bare bones subsistence level of living standards only during the nineteenth 
century.
