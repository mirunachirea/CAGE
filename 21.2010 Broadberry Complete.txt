Abstract: We provide annual estimates of GDP for England over the period 1270-1700, constructed from the output side. The GDP data are combined with population estimates to calculate GDP per capita. Sectoral price data and estimates of nominal GDP are also provided. We find per capita income growth of 0.20 per cent per annum, although growth was episodic, with the strongest growth after the Black Death and in the second half of the seventeenth century. Living standards in the late medieval period were well above “bare bones subsistence”, although levels of kilocalorie consumption per head were modest because of the very large share of pastoral production in agriculture.

I. INTRODUCTION 
There are two conflicting views of the long run development of living standards in the 
English economy. One view, which is based largely on real wage evidence, paints a bleak 
picture of long run stagnation from the late thirteenth century to the middle of the 
nineteenth century, albeit with quite large fluctuations over sustained periods (Phelps 
Brown and Hopkins, 1981). This view has recently been supported by Clark (2005), who 
provides a real wage series which shows less extreme fluctuations than that of Phelps 
Brown and Hopkins, but leaves the trend unchanged. Furthermore, Clark (2007a) adds 
new time series for land rents and capital income to arrive at a picture of long run 
stagnation in GDP per head. This view sits uneasily with a second view, based largely on 
estimates of wealth and the appearance of new products, which appear to show modest 
but sustained growth of living standards between the middle ages and the Industrial 
Revolution (Overton, Whittle, Dean and Haan, 2004; de Vries, 1994). 
These two very different views of the long run development of the English 
economy have been able to co-exist because of the absence of reliable and empirically 
grounded estimates of the output and productivity of the English economy over this 
period. This paper forms part of a project to reconstruct the national income of Britain 
and Holland between the late thirteenth and the late nineteenth centuries, built up form 
the output side. A sister paper by Broadberry and van Leeuwen (2010a) provides 
estimates of GDP for Great Britain covering the period 1700-1870, which provides a 
bridge between the estimates in this paper and the estimates of Feinstein (1972) for the 
post-1870 period.

========3========

For agriculture, we build on the path breaking study of Overton and Campbell 
(1996), which tracked long run trends in agricultural output and labour productivity, but 
was restricted to estimates for a small number of benchmark years. To provide annual 
estimates, we rely heavily on two data sets assembled for the medieval and early modern 
periods. For the medieval period, we analyse the Medieval Accounts Database assembled 
by Campbell (2000; 2007), drawing upon the archival labours of a number of other 
historians, including David Farmer, John Langdon and Jan Titow. The information on 
arable yields and animal stocking densities is taken largely from manorial accounts, but is 
supplemented by information on the non-manorial sector from tithes. For the early 
modern period, we use the probate inventory database assembled by Overton, Whittle, 
Dean and Hann (2004), which provides indirect estimates of arable yields and animal 
stocking densities from the valuation of the assets left by farmers. 
For industry and services, we build on the pioneering approach of Deane and Cole 
(1967), as modified by Crafts and Harley (1992). Gross output indicators for the major 
sectors have been assembled and weighted using value added shares. Finally, to 
aggregate the sectoral output series we estimate value added weights for agriculture, 
industry and services in 1381, 1522, 1600 and 1700. 
For the period between 1270 and 1700, we find English per capita income growth 
of 0.20 per cent per annum on average. This cumulates to more than a doubling of per 
capita incomes, although growth was episodic rather than continuous, with the strongest 
3 

========4========

growth occurring during the Black Death crisis of the fourteenth century and in the 
second half of the seventeenth century. Combining this with the estimates in Broadberry 
and van Leeuwen (2010a) and working back from the present, the modest trend growth in 
per capita income since 1270 suggests that living standards in the late medieval period 
were well above what Allen (2009: 36-41) calls “bare bones subsistence”. This can be 
reconciled with modest levels of kilocalorie consumption per head because of the very 
large share of pastoral production in agriculture. This meant that a large share of the 
English population were already in a position during the late Middle Ages to afford what 
Allen calls the “respectable lifestyle”, with a more varied diet including meat, dairy 
produce and ale, as well as the less highly processed grain products that comprised the 
bulk of the bare bones subsistence diet. 
Our estimates of GDP are built up primarily from the output side. However, the 
national accounting perspective suggests a number of tests which can be conducted to 
demonstrate consistency, drawing on estimates from the income and expenditure sides. In 
particular, we check consistency with the real wage estimates which have been used 
frequently by economic historians to draw conclusions about long run living standards 
(Clark, 2005; Allen, 2001). Second, we also consider per capita consumption of 
kilocalories, to check the sustainability of the population (Overton and Campbell, 1996). 
The paper proceeds as follows. Sections II to IV describe the procedures for 
estimating output in agriculture, industry and services, respectively. Section V then 
aggregates the sectoral outputs into real GDP and combines this with data on population 
4 

========5========

to derive estimates of per capita GDP. In section VI, real GDP by sector is reflated with 
sectoral price indices to provide a measure of nominal GDP, which can be compared with 
benchmark estimates produced by other authors. In section VII, we compare the long run 
evolution of per capita GDP derived from the output side with real wages and examine 
the per capita consumption of kilocalories in the light of Allen’s (2009) distinction 
between bare bones subsistence and respectable lifestyle baskets. Section VIII concludes. 
II. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 
1. Arable farming 
The starting point for any estimate of the output of the arable sector is the total area under 
crop, which is set out in Table 1. For most benchmark years, the data differ slightly from 
Overton and Campbell (1996), as a result of the incorporation of subsequent scholarship. 
For 1700, we rely on estimates by contemporaries reported in Holderness (1989) for the 
trends between 1700 and 1850, but with the absolute level pinned down by Prince’s 
(1989: 41) interpretation of the 1801 Crop Returns. The figure for 1600 has been 
obtained by interpolating backwards in line with population. For the medieval period, the 
starting point is the estimate for 1300. Around this time, the population attained its 
medieval peak, so that the arable acreage would also have been at its peak. Contrary to 
the claims of Clark (2007b: 124), it is unlikely that the arable acreage in 1300 could have 
been much above the level of 1800. Estimates for other years between 1270 and 1500 are 
obtained by extrapolation from 1300 on the basis of trends in the cropped acreage on 
demesnes and tithe data in the non-demesne sector (Campbell et al., 1996; Dodds, 2004; 
Medieval Accounts Database). 
5 

========6========

Having obtained estimates of the overall arable acreage in use, the next step is to 
allocate it between fallow and the major crops sown. This information is taken from the 
Medieval Accounts Database for the period before 1500 and the Early Modern Probate 
Inventories Database for the period 1500-1700. For the medieval period, it should be 
noted that we assume the distribution of crops in the demesne sector to be representative 
of the country as a whole. This is broadly consistent with the much smaller amount of 
evidence on the non-demesne sector (Sapoznik, 2008; Dodds, 2007). For the period 
between 1492 and 1553, there is a gap in information as the manorial records come to an 
end before the probate inventories become available. 
The amount of fallow declined from between a third and a half in the medieval 
period to less than a quarter in the early modern period. Information on the crop 
distribution is taken from data that are intrinsically local and of uneven geographical 
coverage, so that a system of regional weightings is essential to ensure a reliable national 
total. Each region’s share of the national sown acreage is taken from the 1801 crop 
returns, but within each region, the breakdown of crops varies over time in line with the 
information in the databases. The winter-sown crops, including rye and maslin (a mixture 
of wheat and rye) as well as wheat, remained important throughout the period. Amongst 
the spring-sown crops, barley and dredge (a mixture of barley and oats) increased in 
importance, while oats declined. Pulses and other crops (largely clover and root crops) 
increased in importance during the early modern period (Overton, 1996: 99-101, 110). 
6 

========7========

To calculate output from the estimated areas sown with each crop requires 
information on grain yields per acre, net of seed sown. Weighted national average yields 
per acre, gross of tithe and seed can be obtained from the manorial accounts for the 
medieval period and the probate inventories for the early modern period. Each dataset has 
been divided into seven regional groupings and separate chronologies have been 
constructed for each region before being combined into a single weighted master 
chronology for the country as a whole. Due to the discontinuous nature of much of the 
data, the chronologies are derived using regression analysis with dummy variables for 
each farm and for each year, as suggested by Clark (2004). Since our evidence is drawn 
from the seigniorial sector, we need to consider what was happening in the non-demesne 
sector. Although Postan (1966) clearly believed that yields were higher on the demesnes 
as a result of access to better land and more capital, Stone (2006: 21) has recently argued 
that yields were around 11 per cent higher in the non-demesne sector, where incentives 
were stronger for peasants. Since the direction of the adjustment is unclear, and would 
anyway be quite small, we have assumed that yields on the demesne sector were 
representative of English agriculture as a whole, although we will consider the 
implications of relaxing this assumption in a later section. 
Grain yields gross of seed as well as tithe are shown in Figure 1 for wheat, rye, 
barley, oats and pulses. From these gross yields it is necessary to subtract grain used as 
seed to derive the net yields shown in Table 2 for all the major crops. There are some 
differences between crops, but the different datasets appear to tell a consistent story, with 
yields declining during the late medieval period from around 1300, picking up again 
7 

========8========

during the early modern period from the mid-sixteenth century. The data exhibit a high 
degree of short run volatility, which has been smoothed out in Figure 1 with a 10-year 
moving average. 
In addition to making allowance for grain used as seed, calculation of the net 
output of the arable sector must take account of consumption of oats and pulses by 
animals working on the farm. Estimates of the numbers of working animals per 100 sown 
acres can be obtained from the medieval accounts and probate inventory databases. For 
the early modern period, these stocking densities are assumed to apply to the whole 
agricultural sector and hence are simply multiplied with the sown acreage to produce 
estimates of the numbers of working animals. However, for the medieval period, the 
demesne stocking densities have been converted into the numbers of horses and oxen on 
all lands using Wrigley’s (2006: 449) assumption that the stocking density of animals on 
non-seigniorial holdings was three-quarters that on the demesnes. In making these 
estimates, allowance has been made for both the declining share of demesne acreage and 
the lesser quantities of fodder consumed by immature animals. As with the crop yields, a 
regional weighting scheme is needed to derive the stocking densities for the country as a 
whole from the observations on individual demesnes and farms. 
Figure 2 sets out the numbers of mature working animals in England. There was a 
gradual process of substitution of horses for oxen as working animals, beginning in the 
medieval period and accelerating during the early modern period. Using assumptions 
about consumption of oats and pulses by mature and immature animals, it is possible to 
8 

========9========

derive estimates of farm animal consumption, which are then subtracted from gross 
output to derive arable output net of seed and animal consumption in Table 3. 
During the medieval period, output of wheat and rye, the principal bread grains, 
declined substantially from the late thirteenth century peak, with a sharp fall in line with 
population following the Black Death of the mid-fourteenth century. The output decline 
was even sharper for oats, which fell out of favour as a crop for human consumption. In 
place of malted oats, malted dredge (a barley/oats mixture) and malted barley became the 
preferred brewing grains, and demand for barley remained relatively buoyant. Output of 
pulses also declined relatively slowly during the medieval period. 
By the end of the sixteenth century, output of the major grains was back to the 
peak pre-Black Death level. Output of wheat continued to increase after 1600, while rye 
declined. This reflected the growing preference for the more expensive bread grain. The 
output of barley increased markedly in line with the demand for better quality ale brewed 
from the best barley malt. Output of pulses also grew rapidly during the early modern 
period. Output of oats, net of consumption by farm horses, fluctuated more erratically, 
but on a downward trend. 
2. Pastoral farming 
The starting point for deriving the numbers of non-working animals is again the stocking 
densities. As with the working animals, particular care must be taken for the medieval 
period in moving from the stocking densities on the demesnes to the numbers of animals 
9 

========10========

in the country as a whole. Conversion of the seigniorial stocking densities into 
corresponding national densities and numbers of animals is based on four key 
assumptions. First, following Allen (2005), it has been assumed that due to their high unit 
capital value, the density of cattle was one-third lower on the non-demesne lands. 
However, we have also made an allowance for the negative relationship between farm 
size and stocking density, drawn from the post-1550 data. Second, again following Allen 
(2005), mature cattle have been divided into milk and beef animals in the ratio 53 to 47 
percent. Third, swine, a popular animal with peasants, are assumed to have been stocked 
by non-seigniorial producers at the same density as on the demesnes.1 Fourth, aggregate 
sheep numbers are assumed to have been stationary in the long term, in contrast to their 
dynamic growth in the seigniorial sector. This is consistent with trends in exports, 
inferred levels of domestic demand, and the decline in average fleece weights noted by 
Stephenson (1988: 380). Stocking densities can also be obtained for the early modern 
period from probate inventories. Non-working animal numbers for the whole period 
1270-1700 are shown in Figure 3, taking 10-year moving averages to smooth out short 
run volatility. 
Calculating the output of the pastoral sector is more speculative than the 
equivalent calculation for the arable sector, since the percentages of animals producing 
specific products and the yields per animal have attracted less attention from historians 
than crop yields. Until more systematic work is done on the sources, the estimates 
advanced here are necessarily provisional. 
1 
Note that if we were to adopt Wrigley’s (2006) assumption that swine were stocked at twice the manorial density by peasants, this would produce an implausibly large jump in swine numbers between the late medieval and early modern periods. 
10 

========11========

Table 4 sets out the numbers of non-working animals, with cattle divided between 
milk and beef herds and calves. The proportions of animals assumed to have been 
producing milk, meat and wool are set out in Table 5. A high proportion of cows are 
assumed to have produced milk and a high proportion of sheep to have yielded wool. 
Meat, however, was produced only by those animals that were slaughtered. Following 
Holderness (1989: 147), it is assumed that approximately a quarter of the stock of cattle 
and sheep and around half of all pigs were slaughtered in the early modern period. These 
ratios are also applied to the late medieval period for sheep and pigs, in line with 
slaughter rates documented by Campbell (1995: 164-167). For cattle, however, slaughter 
rates were lower in the medieval period because there were few herds kept specifically 
for beef. These basic assumptions have been qualified with additional information from 
Clark (1991) and Ecclestone (1996). 
The next step in the calculations involves the estimation of yields of milk, meat 
and wool per animal. Table 6 sets out our preferred estimates, drawn from a number of 
sources, including Clark (1991), Allen (2005), Stephenson (1988) and Britnell (2004). 
Data between benchmark years were interpolated using information on the relative prices 
of pastoral products and the animals from which they were derived. Finally, Table 7 
combines the information on numbers of animals, percentages of each animal producing 
and yields per animal to provide estimates of output in the pastoral farming sector. 
11 

========12========

Further assumptions are needed to derive output estimates for hay, hides and 
skins, and dairy products. Hay output is derived from the numbers of non-farm horses, on 
the assumption that each horse consumed 2.4 tons of hay per year (Allen, 2005). Output 
of hides and skins is derived from the numbers of working and non-working animals 
using assumptions on the percentages of each animal producing and yields per animal 
from Clark (1991), Clarkson (1989) and Ecclestone (1996). In the dairy sector, output is 
split between cheese, butter and fresh milk using data from Biddick (1989) and 
Holderness (1989). 
3. Total agricultural output 
Multiplying the output volumes by their prices yields the total value of net output. The 
price data are taken largely from Clark (2004), who synthesises the published data of 
Beveridge (1939), Thorold Rogers (1866-1902: volumes 1-30) and the multi-volume 
Agrarian History of England and Wales, as well as integrating new archival material, 
principally from the unpublished papers of William Beveridge and David Farmer. To 
this, have been added the prices of hides from Thorold Rogers (1866-1902) and of rye 
from Farmer (1988; 1991), as well as direct estimates from the Early Modern Probate 
Inventories Database. Output can be valued in both current prices and in constant 1700 
prices. 
Figure 4 plots arable, pastoral and total agricultural output in constant prices on a 
logarithmic scale, while Table 8 summarises the same information in growth rate form, 
using 10-year averages to capture long run trends. It should be noted that the gap between 
12 

========13========

1492 and 1553 in the series for arable and pastoral production has been filled at the level 
of total agricultural output using the demand function approach of Crafts (1985) and 
Allen (2000). Agricultural consumption per head is assumed to be a function of its own 
price (PA), the general price level (PY) and income (Y). Income and price elasticities are 
estimated from the data for output (adjusted for net imports), prices and real wages over 
the period 1301-1492 and 1553-1700, and used to predict the missing values of output 
between 1492 and 1553, based upon the known values of prices and real wages for this 
period. The results are discussed in detail in Broadberry and van Leeuwen (2010b). 
During the medieval period, arable output exhibited a clear downward trend, 
while pastoral output showed greater stability. Agriculture as a whole thus showed a 
modest decline in output. From the mid-sixteenth century, arable and pastoral output both 
grew, with the pastoral sector at first lagging behind the arable sector, but outpacing it 
from the mid-seventeenth century. 
The pastoral sector was thus increasing its share of real agricultural output during 
the medieval period and from the mid-seventeenth century. However, in current price 
terms the picture is complicated by changes in relative prices. In particular, although the 
price of pastoral products relative to arable showed no clear trend during the medieval 
period, pastorasl products became steadily cheaper after 1500, particularly during the 
“Great Inflation” of the sixteenth century, as can be seen in Figure 5. This amplified the 
effects of the slower real growth of the pastoral sector between the 1450s and the 1650s, 
and then dampened the effects of the faster pastoral growth after 1650. Thus the current 
13 

========14========

price data in Figure 6A and Table 9 show the pastoral sector increasing its share of output 
during the medieval period and again from the mid-seventeenth century. Between the 
mid-fifteenth century and the mid-seventeenth century, by contrast, the share of the 
pastoral sector in current price agricultural output declined. In constant 1700 prices, 
however, the early modern decline in the share of pastoral agriculture was much more 
muted, as can be seen in Figure 6B. 
However, what is perhaps most striking about Table 9 is the already very high 
share of the pastoral sector in medieval England. This meant that although the English 
people did not have a particularly generous diet if viewed in terms of kilocalories, it was 
a varied diet, with meat, dairy produce and ale to supplement the less highly processed 
grain products that made up the bulk of the diet. 
III. INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION 
For the period 1270-1700, it is possible to obtain volume measures of some of the key 
industries, which can be broken down into three major sectors: metals and mining; 
textiles and leather; and other industries. Figure 7 plots the component series of the three 
major sectors in parts A to C, while part D plots the three major sectors, together with the 
total industrial production index. 
1. Metal and mining industries 
The metals and mining sector is based on physical output volumes for a number of 
important industries. Tin output is available on an annual basis for the whole period from 
14 

========15========

1301 with relatively few gaps, from Hatcher (1973: 156-159) and Mitchell (1988: 303- 
304). King (2005) provides data on bar iron production for the period 1490-1700. The 
output of coal in the 1560s and circa 1700 is taken from Hatcher (1993: 68), interpolated 
using shipments of coal from north-eastern ports, also taken from Hatcher (1993: 487- 
495), updating the earlier work of Nef (1932: 380-381). In Figure 7A, we see that 
although tin output grew more rapidly than industrial production as a whole, the coal and 
iron industries grew even more rapidly, particularly during the sixteenth century. 
2. Textiles and leather 
The textiles and leather sector is based on volume indicators of the key raw material 
inputs of wool and animal hides. Exports of wool and woollen cloth are given by Carus- 
Wilson and Coleman (1963) for the period 1280-1554. However, the export of wool is 
negatively related to the export of cloth, so we use the production of wool from 
agriculture minus wool exports as an indicator of the woollen textile industry. It should 
be noted that although the period between the mid-fourteenth and mid-fifteenth centuries 
was characterised by strong growth of wool cloth exports, this was offset by the decline 
in home consumption as population declined. The output of hides from pastoral 
agriculture is used to track the output of the leather industry. Figure 7B shows that 
woollen textiles grew more rapidly than the leather industry. 
3. Other industries 
Food processing, building and book production are grouped together as the relatively 
heterogeneous group of other industries. Food processing is assumed to grow in line with 
15 

========16========

agricultural output. Building is assumed to grow in line with population, but with an 
allowance for urbanisation. For the medieval period, however, allowance has been made 
for church building, using data on the number of cathedral and abbey building projects 
derived from Morris (1979: 179). Book production is measured by the index of new 
English language book titles obtained from the British Library’s English Short Title 
Catalogue (http://estc.bl.uk/F/?func=file&file_name=login-bl-list). Figure 7C shows that 
book production grew much more rapidly than food processing and construction, 
although the growth rate accelerated in construction with the growing urbanisation of the 
English economy after 1500. 
4. Aggregate industrial production 
To aggregate the individual series into an overall industrial production index and the sub- 
indices for the three component major sectors, we require a set of weights. The weights 
for circa 1700 in Table 10 are derived from Hoffmann (1955), but with a number of 
modifications, including an allowance for the production of books as well as the 
reworking of the weighting scheme by Crafts et al. (1989). 
Figure 7D plots the index of industrial production on a logarithmic scale, together 
with the three major sector sub-indices. Table 11 summarises the aggregate information 
in growth rate form over fifty year periods, using 10-year averages to capture long run 
trends. Following a period of stagnation in industrial production as population declined 
after the Black Death, there was a return to industrial growth after 1500, which can be 
16 

========17========

discerned clearly in Figure 7D. The average annual growth rate over the period 1270- 
1700 was 0.32 per cent. 
IV. SERVICES 
The service sector has received much less attention from economic historians than 
agriculture and industry. Here, we build on the approach used by Deane and Cole (1967) 
to estimate service sector output in eighteenth century Britain. For England 1270-1700, 
we break down services into government, commerce, and housing and domestic service. 
1. Commerce 
For commerce, we combine indicators of international trade and transport, domestic trade 
and transport and finance, which are plotted in Figure 8. We begin with a description of 
the index for international trade and transport, which combines information on the 
volume of exports, the distances travelled by those exports and the growth of the English 
merchant shipping tonnage. The export volume data are available on an annual basis for 
wool and cloth exports from all major English ports between 1280 and 1543 in Carus- 
Wilson and Coleman (1963), with the national totals conveniently summarised in 
Mitchell (1988: 358-359). Wool and cloth, which together accounted for 86.6 per cent of 
the value of total exports in 1565, are aggregated into an index of export volumes using 
weights of 90 per cent for cloth and 10 per cent for wool, derived from Stone (1949: 37). 
The series has been extended over the period 1270-1280 on the assumption that the 
stability of the export to domestic production ratio during the period 1280-1290 also held 
during the previous decade, for which domestic wool production data are available. For 
17 

========18========

the period after 1500, data on shortcloth exports through London are available from 
Fisher (1940: 96) for the period 1500-1600 and from Fisher (1950: 153) for the period 
1600-1640, with the overwhelming dominance of London in the trade demonstrated by 
Davis (1954: 164-165) for the seventeenth century and by Carus-Wilson and Coleman 
(1963) for the sixteenth century. Log-linear interpolation has been used for missing 
years. 
To capture the volume of international transport as well as commerce, it is 
necessary to take account of the distances over which these exports were shipped, which 
changed over time with the shifting importance of different trade routes. An important 
factor here was the growing importance from around 1500 of the new trade routes to the 
east around the south of Africa and to the Americas across the Atlantic, since the 
distances on these routes dwarfed distances on the intra-European trade routes. Davis 
(1954: 164-165) provides a regional breakdown of export destinations for the mid- 
seventeenth century, which are adjusted to a pre-1500 pattern by eliminating the new 
trade routes to the Americas and Asia. 
After 1640 there is an unfortunate gap in the trade data until the new official 
figures which start in 1697. However, for the period 1570-1700, we have data on the 
English merchant shipping tonnage from Davis (1962). For the overlap period 1570- 
1640, we have used the export data to interpolate between the much lower frequency 
shipping tonnage data. This enables us to capture both the volatility of international 
18 

========19========

commerce and the growing share of that commerce being shipped by English merchants 
with the encouragement of mercantilist governments (Supple, 1964; Davis, 1973: 46-49). 
Domestic trade and transport is measured by an index of marketed agricultural 
and industrial output. An index of industrial and agricultural output is constructed from 
the sectoral real output data described earlier. Changes in the share of output marketed 
are captured by the cumulative number of new markets established in the period 1300- 
1490 and the growth of the urban share of the population from 1490 to 1700. The data on 
the growth of the market are taken from Letters (2005), while the data on urbanisation are 
from Malanima (2009). 
The extent of financial mediation in the economy is measured by the inverse of 
the velocity of circulation, derived from Mayhew (2009). The long run decline of 
velocity during the process of economic development was noted by Cameron (1967), 
focusing on the experience of a number of countries, including England between 1750 
and 1844. He particularly emphasised the institutional changes associated with the 
development of new forms of money, such as bills of exchange, with lower velocity than 
cash. Declining velocity can therefore be taken as an indicator of the growth of a more 
sophisticated financial services sector. Mayhew (1995) extended the analysis back to 
1300 and confirmed Cameron’s finding of a long run decline in velocity, but with an 
interruption to the process during the Tudor debasement of the mid-sixteenth century. 
Mayhew (2009) provides an update to his earlier study, incorporating revised money 
supply data from Allen (2001). To convert this measure of financial intermediation into 
19 

========20========

an index of financial sector activity, we interact the inverse of the velocity of circulation 
with the population, as a scaling factor. 
The fastest growing part of commerce was domestic trade and transport, with two 
strong phases of growth. The first growth phase occurred with the rise of markets before 
the Black Death, while the second growth phase occurred with the spread of urbanisation 
after 1500. International trade and transport showed little trend growth before 1500, but 
then grew rapidly during the mercantilist period from the sixteenth century onwards. The 
financial sector declined with population after the Black Death and then showed 
relatively modest growth from the mid-fifteenth century, but with a serious setback 
during the Great Debasement of the mid-sixteenth century. 
2. Housing and domestic service 
Deane and Cole (1967) assumed that housing and domestic service grew in line with 
population, and we have followed the same procedure here. Output therefore declined 
sharply across the Black Death, continued to fall until the mid-fifteenth century and then 
recovered until the mid-seventeenth century. 
3. Government 
For government, we use a 10-year moving average of real government revenue from 
O’Brien and Hunt (1999), which is available for the whole period from the European 
State Finance Database at http://www.le.ac.uk/hi/bon/ESFDB/frameset.html. The state 
20 

========21========

expanded its size rapidly during the wars of the late medieval period, and again with the 
rise of the mercantilist state during the seventeenth century. 
4. Aggregate service sector output 
The weights for the main service sectors are shown in Table 12, and are taken from the 
circa 1700 shares in Crafts (1985: 16). Within commerce, the weights are derived as 
follows. First, the relative shares of domestic and international trade and transport are 
based on the relative shares for Holland, adjusted for the different degree of openness in 
England compared to Holland. Since the share of exports and imports in GDP was lower 
in England than in Holland, domestic trade and transport accounted for a higher share of 
commerce in England than in Holland, and international trade and transport for a 
correspondingly lower share. Second, the share of finance is set at 5.0 per cent of total 
service sector output, which amounts to around 1.7 per cent of GDP, the share of finance 
in GDP for 1907, the first benchmark year for which current price sectoral shares are 
available for Britain with a separate enumeration of finance (Feinstein, 1972: 208). 
The resulting series for total service sector output is plotted in Figure 8B, and the 
growth rates for the whole period and sub-periods are presented in Table 13. Total 
service sector output trended downwards during the medieval period, before picking up 
strongly form the mid-fifteenth century. The slowest growing sector was housing and 
domestic services, while the fastest growing sector was government, particularly before 
1350. Commerce grew rapidly from the mid-sixteenth century. The average annual 
growth rate for the aggregate service sector over the period 1270-1700 was 0.21 per cent. 
21 

========22========

V. REAL GDP, POPULATION AND GDP PER CAPITA 
The next step is to construct an index of real GDP for England over the period 1270-1700 
from the above series for agriculture, industry and services, using an appropriate set of 
weights. Table 14 sets out the weighting scheme, derived from reconstruction of nominal 
GDP by sector. Real output trends from the sectoral series described earlier in the paper 
are transformed into current price trends using sectoral price deflators, with absolute 
levels of GDP in current prices established using an input-output table for 1841. For the 
period 1270-1450, we use 1381 weights, a year for which it is also possible to establish 
sectoral labour force shares from the Poll Tax Returns. For the period 1450-1550, we use 
1522 weights, matching labour force shares derived from the Muster Rolls. For 1550- 
1650, we use 1600 weights. Finally, for 1650-1700, we use circa 1700 weights, matching 
the labour force estimates derived from the original study by Gregory King [1696]. The 
resulting series, plotted in Figure 9, can be used to calculate growth rates over 50-year 
periods, presented in Table 15. English GDP trended down after the Black Death, before 
returning to positive growth from the late fifteenth century. Over the whole period 1270- 
1700, the English economy averaged a growth rate of 0.24 per cent per annum. 
Ultimately, we are interested in what happened to GDP per capita, the most 
widely accepted indicator of material living standards over the long run. Although the 
population of England has been firmly reconstructed by Wrigley and Schofield (1989) 
and Wrigley et al. (1997) for the period since the compulsory registration of births, 
marriages and deaths, estimates before 1541 are more speculative. For the period after 
22 

========23========

1541, the data in Table 16 are based on the estimates of Wrigley et al. (1997), 
interpolated using Wrigley and Schofield (1989). For earlier years, our estimates are 
based on data for individual manors, extending forwards in time the approach of Hallam 
(1988). It should be noted that our peak medieval population estimate of 4.81 million in 
1348 is a little higher than the range of 4.0 to 4.5 million suggested by Overton and 
Campbell (1996), but still well below the figure of at least 6 million suggested by Postan 
(1966) and Smith (1991). As Overton and Campbell (1996) point out, such a high 
population estimate has implications for other variables such as land use, crop 
combinations, yields and kilocalorie extraction rates and the share of the population 
living in towns, which would be hard to square with other evidence. We shall return to 
this issue in a later section on consumption and output. Note the impact of the Black 
Death, which struck in 1348-49, sharply accelerating a population decline that was 
already underway in the early fourteenth century. 
Combining the population data with the real GDP series produces our estimates of 
GDP per capita growth in Table 17. The trend is of modest positive per capita income 
growth between 1270 and1700, at an average annual rate of 0.20 per cent. However, the 
path of growth was episodic. We find that GDP per capita grew substantially during the 
Black Death crisis of the fourteenth century, and then remained on a plateau between 
circa 1450 and 1650 before resuming growth during the second half of the seventeenth 
century. These trends can also be seen in Figure 10, which plots GDP per capita on a 
logarithmic scale. Note that although there were some isolated bad years between 1550 
23 

========24========

and 1650, the trend level of per capita income remained above the level of the pre-Black 
Death period. 
Per capita income growth before the Industrial Revolution thus appears to be 
confined largely to periods of falling population. This may at first sight appear to confirm 
the Malthusian interpretation of writers such as Postan (1972) and Clark (2007a). The 
Malthusian model depends on two key assumptions. First, population responds positively 
to real incomes, so that if real income falls, fertility declines (the preventive check) and 
mortality increases (the positive check). Second, there is a negative relationship between 
the population level and real income, because of diminishing returns to labour, holding 
land fixed. However, it is helpful to follow Mokyr and Voth (2010) in distinguishing 
between the strong and weak versions of the Malthusian model. In the strong version, the 
iron law of wages holds, so that if there is a positive shock to real incomes, they are 
quickly forced back down to “bare bones” subsistence. In the weaker version, the positive 
and preventive checks operate, but not sufficiently strongly to bring the economy back to 
bare bones subsistence. In the weaker version of the Malthusian model, a society may 
have a per capita income level sufficient for the majority of the population to afford the 
respectability basket, as a result, for example, of restrictions on fertility through late 
marriage. 
The evidence for pre-industrial England presented above is clearly not consistent 
with the strong version of the Malthusian model offered by Postan (1972). First, although 
population was above the medieval peak by 1700, per capita incomes were around twice 
24 

========25========

as high. The economy was able to support a larger population with a smaller proportion 
working in agriculture, freeing up others to produce the industrial goods and services 
demanded in a more urbanised society. Second, although it is not known when it first 
became the norm, late marriage is known to have been prevalent in early modern England 
(Wrigley and Schofield, 1989; Wrigley et al., 1997). Third, fertility limitation and the 
high share of the pastoral sector meant that living standards for the majority were 
“respectable” in 1300, and remained so throughout the period. Nevertheless, it must be 
emphasised that there was a sizeable minority of people at the bottom of the income 
distribution who were living at bare bones subsistence. Allen (2009: 50) suggests that this 
group represented 18.3 per cent of the population in 1688, while the social tables 
constructed by Campbell (2008: 940) for 1290 suggest that this proportion may have 
been as high as 26 per cent in the medieval period. 
The above interpretation is consistent with the weak Malthusian model. However, 
there is an important way in which pre-industrial England does not fit the Malthusian 
interpretation, either strong or weak. This is the important role of the growth of London. 
Whereas Malthus clearly thought in terms of a negative relationship between population 
density and real income levels through diminishing returns, there is much evidence to 
suggest that the growth of London acted as a stimulus to productivity and real income 
levels (Wrigley, 1985; Allen, 2009). This is more in line with the positive relationship 
between population density and real income levels hypothesised by Boserup (1965; 
1981), through effects on intensity of land use in surrounding rural areas and investment 
in density-dependent infrastructure in the metropolitan centre, thus creating increasing 
25 

========26========

rather than diminishing returns. Furthermore, Campbell et al. (1993) demonstrate the 
positive influence of the large London market on the organisation of agricultural 
production in the surrounding counties already during the medieval period, thus casting 
doubt on a fundamental assumption of the Malthusian model long before the Industrial 
Revolution. 
VI. PRICES AND NOMINAL GDP 
Real GDP can be converted to current prices by reflating the sectoral volume indices by 
sectoral price series. The absolute values of nominal GDP can be pinned down using 
benchmark figures for 1700.2 
1. Sectoral and aggregate price indices 
The starting point is the price indices that have been constructed for the three main 
sectors of agriculture, industry and services. The agricultural price series have been 
described in an earlier section, and are taken largely from Clark (2004). For industry, 
prices are taken from Clark (2006) and Thorold Rogers (1866-1902). The price data for 
services are based largely on wage rates and housing rents from Clark (2004), although 
we have also incorporated some information on transport prices from Thorold Rogers 
(1866-1902). For distribution, we have used a weighted average of agricultural and 
industrial prices, with the weights reflecting the relative size of the two sectors. 
2 
The 1700 benchmark figures are obtained by projecting back from an 1841 benchmark using sectoral indices of real output and prices for the period 1700-1841 from Broadberry and van Leeuwen (2010a). 
26 

========27========

Figure 11 shows that prices in the three main sectors moved broadly together over 
the long run, although there were shorter periods when significant changes occurred in 
the inter-sectoral terms of trade. Figure 12 charts the ratio of agricultural prices to 
industrial prices, indexed on 1700=100. Agricultural prices were relatively high during 
the first half of the fourteenth century when population was at its medieval peak. After 
the Black Death, however, agricultural prices fell relative to industrial prices and 
remained at a lower ratio until the mid-sixteenth century. The first half of the seventeenth 
century stands out as a further period of relatively high agricultural prices. 
2. Nominal GDP 
Reflating real GDP with the aggregate price index produces the nominal GDP series 
plotted in Figure 13 in £ million. Here we also plot some benchmark estimates of nominal 
GDP produced by Snooks (1995) and Mayhew (1995), which suggests that previous 
writers have succeeded in capturing the broad trends in nominal GDP over this long 
period. However, a closer examination of the data for benchmark years in Table 18 
suggests that Snooks substantially underestimated the level of nominal GDP in 1300, thus 
exaggerating the growth of nominal GDP between 1300 and 1688. 
3. Nominal and real GDP 
Figure 14 plots real and nominal GDP together with the aggregate price level over the 
period 1270-1700. It is clear that most of the increase in nominal GDP resulted merely 
from inflation. While real GDP increased by a factor of 2.8 between 1270 and 1700, 
nominal GDP increased by a much greater factor of 17.6, as a result of the price level 
27 

========28========

increasing by a factor of 6.3. Put like this, inflation sounds very high, but compared with 
the twentieth century, this is relatively mild inflation, at an annual rate of just 0.43 per 
cent. Furthermore, it is clear that most of the increase in the price level occurred during 
the Great Inflation of the sixteenth century, a Europe-wide and possibly global 
phenomenon. 
VI. CROSS-CHECKING THE OUTPUT ESTIMATES 
1. Consumption and output 
One way of assessing the credibility of the output estimates is to see what they imply 
about the level and sufficiency of consumption per head. Table 19 assesses the supply of 
kilocalories available per head of the population. Livi-Bacci (1991) believes that for a 
population to have been adequately fed required an average food intake of 2,000 
kilocalories per capita per day, although for a largely agrarian economy such as medieval 
England, it is reasonable to assume that some of the kilocalories requirements could have 
been met from home-raised vegetables and poultry, together with wild nuts, berries, fish 
and game. We should thus be looking for the main arable crops and pastoral products of 
the agricultural sector to produce around 1,500 kilocalories per person per day to meet 
the subsistence needs of the population. 
The estimates suggest that agricultural output was more than sufficient to meet 
society’s needs after the Black Death, but was significantly less so in 1310/19, the decade 
of the Great Famine. The picture of English society in the half century before the Black 
Death that emerges from this table is thus one of an economy under pressure. Note also 
28 

========29========

that it is hard to see how a population much above the 4.72 million average over the 
decade 1300/09 could have been sustained, given the grain yields and the levels of land 
use underpinning the output estimates. Even allowing for a 10 per cent higher arable 
production in the non-demesne-sector, as suggested by Stone (2006), would not change 
the picture dramatically, as can be seen in the final column. 
One issue which is apparent from Table 19 and from the very high share of the 
pastoral sector highlighted in Table 9 is that a lot of land was devoted to producing 
relatively expensive kilocalories. Thus the medieval English population does not seem 
particularly well off if living standards are assessed in terms of kilocalories. However, the 
diet was highly varied, with a large proportion of the population able to consume meat, 
dairy produce and ale. This is in striking contrast to a strongly Malthusian economy, with 
real wages driven down to bare bones subsistence, where the bulk of the population 
would be deriving the majority of their kilocalories from inferior grains with little 
processing, such as oatmeal (Allen, 2009: 35-37). 
2. Income and output based measures 
An alternative way to assess the credibility of our output estimates is to compare them 
with the long-established estimates of real wages. Phelps Brown and Hopkins (1981) 
produced long time series of daily real wages for skilled and unskilled building workers 
in England, which apparently painted a picture of Malthusian fluctuations but long run 
stationarity of material living standards over the period 1270-1870. Subsequent 
refinements by Allen (2001) present a more subtle picture, with the real wage gains 
29 

========30========

following the Black Death being maintained in England and Holland, but eaten away by 
subsequent population growth in the rest of Europe. Clark (2005) continues to show a 
substantial decline in English real wages from their medieval peak before recovery from 
the mid-seventeenth century. Figure 15 charts our per capita GDP estimates together with 
the Allen and Clark real wage series for unskilled building workers. Real GDP per capita 
moves more closely in line with the Allen real wage series over this period. 
VIII. CONCLUSION 
This paper provides the first annual estimates of GDP for England between 1270 and 
1700, constructed from the output side. For agriculture, the estimates rest on a detailed 
reconstruction of arable and pastoral farming, built up from manorial records during the 
medieval period and probate inventories during the early modern period. For industry and 
services, indices of gross output are assembled for the major sectors and combined with 
value added weights. The GDP data are then combined with population estimates to 
calculate GDP per capita. 
Our results suggest English per capita income growth of 0.20 per cent per annum 
between 1270 and 1700, with the strongest growth after the Black Death and in the 
second half of the seventeenth century. This modest trend growth in per capita income 
before the Industrial Revolution suggests that, working back from the present, living 
standards in the late medieval period were well above “bare bones subsistence”. This can 
be reconciled with modest levels of kilocalorie consumption per head because of the very 
large share of pastoral production in agriculture. Already during the late medieval period, 
30 

========31========

the English economy was on a path of development characterized by high value added, 
capital intensive and non-human energy intensive production.

Sources and notes: Kilocalories per bushel for the medieval period are taken from Campbell et al. (1993: 41). Following Overton and Campbell (1996: Table XIII), storage losses are assumed to have been 10%, with food conversion losses of 20% for wheat and rye, 22% for barley, and 44% for oats when processed into bread, and 70% for barley and oats when malted and brewed into ale/beer. For the post Black Death period (1380/89 to 1450/59) patterns of grain consumption are assumed to have been equivalent to those for 1600 given by Overton and Campbell (1996: Table XII): 98% of wheat and rye and all oats not fed to livestock were eaten. However, we assumed that 50% of barley was eaten and the remainder brewed. For the pre-Black Death period it is assumed that 60% of barley was eaten and only 40% brewed. For 1600- 1850 the estimates of Overton and Campbell (1996: Tables XII and XIII) were 
followed.
