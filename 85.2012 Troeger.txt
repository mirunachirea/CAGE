Abstract: 
This paper analyzes how opportunistic governments choose between alternative fiscal policies in order to increases their chances of re-election. To increase the provision of public goods shortly before elections – and thus, to generate a fiscal political business cycles – governments may either increase deficits or redistribute governmental resources from long- term efficient sources to short-term efficient public programs. We argue that incumbents who face highly competed elections principally have an incentive to spend more on public goods even though these investments are not efficient in the long term. In principal, they would do so by increasing the deficits (with re-balancing the budget after the election). However, our model demonstrates that incumbents would even electioneer at the cost of long-term investments if the extent of fiscal transparency does not allow them to finance the provision of public goods with higher deficits. In other words, if elections are close and voters may observe the governmental deficit, then governments tend to increase the provision of public goods – and consequently, their electoral prospects – by a redistribution of budget resources from long-term efficient investment to a short-term provision of public goods. We test the predictions with new data on the composition of government consumption for 17 OECD countries over 35 years. The preliminary findings suggest that governments indeed reshuffle resources from long-term efficient investment to short-term public goods before elections especially if elections are contested.

Introduction 
Everything else being equal, politicians prefer winning elections to losing them. For this very 
reason, candidates and parties would implement policies that improve their political support in 
the short run even at the expense of long term costs. The easiest way to improve electoral 
chances is by using monetary policy or deficit spending to create a political business cycle – 
that is: a short economic boom before election, which after the election generates economic 
costs such as higher inflation. Everything else being equal, voters prefer not to be fooled. 
They tend to support political candidates who promise to implement political institutions 
which prevent the government from manipulating the economy for electoral purposes. 
Increasing central bank independence, fixing the exchange rate to a monetary anchor within 
relatively narrow bands, and institutions which improve fiscal transparency all serve to 
impede governments from creating a political business cycle. 
We contend that these reforms leave governments with one policy instrument which can 
under certain conditions create political cycles: the restructuring of the budget, an instrument 
that we refer to as budgeteering. Strategic budgeteering occurs when governments shift 
resources from budget items which are efficient in the long run to budget items which 
improve political support in the short run. Strategic budgeteering is a policy instrument of last 
resort: it is politically attractive, but it is less attractive than the misuse of monetary policy or 
deficit spending. Our main argument holds that strategic budgeteering is more likely when the 
incumbent cannot use monetary policy and when fiscal transparency is high so that deficit 
spending becomes politically costly. 
We derive these results in a two-period model in which incumbents have two policy options: 
deficit spending and budgeteering from public investment to public good provision. We 
assume that public investment is efficient only in the long run. Investment leads to economic 
growth which improves voters’ private consumption in the second period. The provision of 
public goods, however, directly enters the voters’ utility in the first, the pre-election period. 
2 

========3========

Governments have an incentive to improve the provision of public goods the more, the closer 
they get to an election. If incumbents decide to run deficit to provide more public goods, 
voters will increase their political support for the incumbent because of the improvements in 
public good provision. At the same time, they will however reduce their support for the 
incumbent because expected consumption in the second period enters the utility calculation of 
the voters and voters adjust this expectation when incumbents reduce public investment. 
However, whether voters can observe the government’s deficit spending immediately or only 
with a delay depends on the transparency of fiscal institutions. Accordingly, if fiscal 
transparency is high, then governments abstain from deficit spending. In this setting, strategic 
budgeteering is the only instrument to increase political support before elections. 
Our theoretical model draws heavily on the research on political business cycles in fiscal 
policies in order to develop an integrated fiscal theory of strategic electioneering. Departing 
from these insights, we do not only show which instruments governments can use to increase 
their chances of re-election and the conditions under which these instruments are effective. 
Most importantly, we shed light on how governments choose between alternative fiscal 
instruments in the pre-election period. Contrary to claims that political cycles in fiscal policies 
do not exist under certain conditions, we show that incumbents always provide more public 
goods before elections, but the way they finance these varies. The more intransparent public 
budgets are, the larger the share of pre-electoral overinvestment in public goods which is 
financed by deficits; the more transparent public budgets are, the larger the share of pre- 
electoral overinvestment in public goods which is financed by strategic budgeteering. 
When Do Monetary and Fiscal Political Business Cycles Occur? 
Low or declining unemployment rates, sufficiently high economic growth rates and inflation 
rates at bay are usually preferred to more stormy weathers. Clearly, these bullish economic 
conditions promise rising wages and increasing purchasing power. Voters like positive 
3 

========4========

expectations. Support for the incumbent government thus tends to co-vary with changes in the 
standards of living. Governing parties thus have a significantly higher chance for winning 
elections during boom cycles. 
This simple logic provides incumbents with ample incentives to stimulate the economy 
shortly before elections even at the expense of the long-term detrimental effect. If 
governments act purely opportunistic and if either voters’ memory does not last forever or 
voters consider current conditions more than previous conditions (Wright 1974, Tufte 1978, 
Frey and Schneider 1978a,b, Golden and Poterba 1980, Schultz 1995, Price 1998), then the 
incumbent is tempted to use all available policy instruments to create a business cycle hike 
before elections at the cost of worsening economic conditions shortly after the elections.1 
This section reviews the main theoretical arguments about the political business cycle and 
broadly distinguishes between monetary and fiscal explanations. We argue that both types of 
explanations are convincing if (but only if) certain institutional conditions apply. Therefore, a 
richer understanding of political business cycles requires that scholars analyze the choice of 
monetary and fiscal policy instruments in conjunction and take the specific constraints 
governments face fully and simultaneously into account. We thus discuss the literature with a 
focus on the conditions under which the choice of a particular instrument is more likely. In the 
theoretical section, we will then more fully explore the interrelatedness of the choice of 
different fiscal instruments when governments are (partly) opportunistic. 
Monetary Policy and the Political Business Cycle 
Early works on the political business cycle were largely motivated by NAIRU-augmented 
version of the ‘Philips curve’. Philips (1958) suggested that when unemployment is high 
inflation is low and vice versa. He thought of this relation as menu of choice: governments 
may use lax monetary policies to raise employment at the expense of additional inflation. The 
NAIRU (non-accelerating inflationary rate of unemployment) revolution argued that a 
1 
This idea can be traced back at least to Schumpeter (1939), Kalecki (1943), Nordhaus (1975), Hibbs (1977, 1978) and Tufte (1978). 
4 

========5========

‘choice’ exists only in the short run. In the longer run, however, unemployment returns to its 
‘natural rate’ while inflation stays higher then before the period of monetary stimulation. 
Apparently, the NAIRU-augmented version of the Philips curve idea does not allow 
governments to determine the average unemployment rate. It, however, allows government to 
manipulate the business cycle because short term reductions in the unemployment rate are 
possible. 
This literature also suffered from the shared assumption that voters’ expectations are not fully 
rational. Rational voters should expect that governments manipulate the economy. They 
therefore adjust their inflation expectations when governments change their monetary policy 
and not just when higher inflation rates become measurable and will be publicly discussed. 
Subsequent explanations of the political business cycle thus replaced the assumption of 
adaptive, retrospective voters and assumed forward-looking voters with rational expectations 
(Alesina 1987, 1988; Rogoff and Sibert 1988; Persson and Tabellini 1990). Forward-looking 
individuals vote for candidates who are most competent in handling the economy. Under this 
assumption, governments may still manipulate the business cycle, but rather than doing so to 
fool the voters they do so to signal their competence. The government in these models 
engages in some sort of brinkmanship: by willingly worsening the budget situation they create 
a situation which can only be handled by a competent government. Since the voters prefer 
ceteris paribus competent to incompetent governments, but cannot observe the candidates’ 
skills independently of their actions in a crisis situation, the government’s behavior is rational 
and helps winning elections. 
Yet, all these models of monetary policy induced political business cycles depend on the 
crucial assumption that governments indeed command over monetary policy. The rapid 
increase in central bank independence on the one hand and European monetary integration on 
the other hand made explanations of the business cycle which were exclusively based on 
monetary policy less and less convincing over the last decades. Why should independent 
5 

========6========

central bankers help the government signaling its competence? Why do voters believe that the 
government is competent if the independent central bank solves macroeconomic tensions by 
choosing an optimal monetary policy? 
Fiscal Policies and the Political Business Cycle 
The monetary policy version of the political business cycle literature was complemented by a 
fiscal sibling. Again, this literature comes in two variants. The first variant explains political 
business cycles by pre-election deficit spending of the government. The second argues that 
governments reshuffle financial resources away from spending which is efficient in the long 
run into budgets which attract votes in the short run. 
Both versions are based on the premise of rational and forward-looking voter. Voters prefer 
candidates who are able to provide more public goods for given levels of taxation and private 
consumption (e.g. Rogoff and Sibert 1988; Rogoff 1990; Shi and Svensson 2002; Alt and 
Lassen 2006a, b). The difference between the two versions is the amount of information 
voters have. In the literature on cycles in deficit spending voters are not informed about the 
candidates’ ability to handle the economy (e.g. Shi and Svensson 2002; Persson and Tabellini 
2002). Additionally, they do not observe the current levels of debt. Governments thus try to 
appear competent by temporarily raising economic growth or improving the welfare of large 
numbers of citizens before an election by providing more public goods.2 They are thereby 
tempted to finance these policies with higher deficits because voters cannot observe (and thus 
would not punish) such a strategy even if it is distorting in the long-run. 
Incomplete information puts an important restriction to those models: Cycles in deficits only 
exist if voters are not able to observe changes in budget deficits. Empirical research shows 
that voters reduce support if they observe governments to increase deficits before elections.3 
The argument that governments ‘signal competence’ remains unconvincing in this case, since 
2

Partisan theories to political business cycles argue that parties have different affinities for example to increase spending on different policy fields (Hibbs 1977; Alesina 1989; Cusack 1997; Boix 2000). E.g. Alesina, Perotti and Tavares 1998; Brender 2003; Brender and Drazen 2005; Drazen and Eslava 2005; Peltzman 1992; Schneider 2007.

no competence is needed to run deficits. Indeed, a competent government would provide 
benefits to voters without increasing deficits. (Drazen 2000b: 101). In other words, if voters 
observe fiscal policy then they will punish the incumbent during elections. The amount of 
information the voter receives about the incumbent’s actions in democratic countries depends 
on the transparency of fiscal institutions within a country (Alt and Lassen 2006a, b; Shi and 
Svensson 2006).4 “Where institutions are less transparent, the cycle in fiscal balance appears, 
while we find no such electorally related movements in higher-transparency countries” (Alt 
and Lassen 2006a: 530).5 
However, incumbents are not restricted to use higher deficits in order to attract additional 
votes. Electoral manipulation in democratic countries could easily take the form of cycles in 
the composition of public spending. Specifically, governments face a trade off when voters 
who dislike high government expenditure and deficits observe fiscal policy. On one hand, 
they aim to achieve a balanced budget before elections to demonstrate their economic 
competence. On the other hand, they have an incentive to provide more public goods in order 
to gain political support. Since voters value some public goods more than others, governments 
could easily increase spending on these items – which Brender and Drazen (2005) call 
targeted spending – while, at the same time, they decrease non-targeted spending, thus 
allowing the overall level of spending – and therefore also the deficit – to remain unchanged 
(Drazen and Eslava 2005, 2006).

Others argue that macro-political budget cycles are restricted to weak and/or new democracies because in those countries voters are less able to monitor and evaluate the fiscal policy process (e.g., Akhmedov and Zhuravskaya 2004; Hallerberg, de Souza and Clark 2002; Persson and Tabellini 2002b, 2003; Shi and Svensson 2000, 2002, 2006; Brender and Drazen 2005). 
Milesi-Feretti (2004) and Rose (2006) examine the impact of fiscal rules on the scope for political business cycles in fiscal policies. Ferejohn (1999) shows that state-enforced media reinforces the effect of low transparency.

institutional, structural, and strategic contexts in which elected, partisan incumbents make 
policy. (…) The magnitude, regularity, and content of electoral and partisan cycles will vary 
with the contexts reflected in differing combinations of conditions (a), (b), and (c)” (Franzese 
2002a: 370). Recently, scholars have addressed these problems by analyzing the conditions 
and the context under which cycles in monetary and fiscal policies are possible. Alt and 
Lassen, for example, have developed a model that explains under which conditions 
incumbents can increase deficits to increase political support in the pre-electoral period 
(Alt/Lassen 2006a, b). However, monetary and fiscal instruments have been analyzed largely 
in isolation and without sufficiently unifying the different conditions under which 
opportunistic political strategies emerge and evolve. Unrestricted governments command over 
monetary and fiscal policies and may use both policies either simultaneously or 
complimentary. If governments lack monetary policy autonomy, the use of fiscal instruments 
opportunistically becomes more likely. At the same time, fiscal political cycles can be caused 
either by deficit spending or by ‘opportunistic strategic budgeteering’. 
Institutionally constraint governments lack full control over at least one of these instruments. 
However, this does not imply that electoral engineering becomes impossible. Indeed, 
governments may always find a way to opportunistically attract voters unless monetary policy 
is fully controlled by an independent central bank, changes in budget deficits are immediately 
observed by voters, and opportunistic budgeteering is impossible. It is not very likely that 
these three conditions apply simultaneously. 
Figure 1 gives account of the unified theory of the political business cycle taking into account 
the various insights from the literature.6 The figure simplifies since all determinants of the 
governments choices (blue) should be treated as continuum rather than as dichotomy. As a 
result, our model does not predict that governments face a either-or choice. Rather, the

We are not the first to suggest a unified model of the political business cycle, see Clark and Hallerberg 2000. Flexible exchange rates limit the effectiveness of fiscal policies and thereby the scope of incumbents to increase political support via deficit spending. Central Bank Independence (CBI) and the European Monetary Union (EMU) may also have effects on the existence and scope of electoral cycles.

We take the different fiscal strategies which where discussed in the literature into account and 
analyze them in an integrated theoretical framework. Consequentially, we can derive the 
conditions under which we should either see no pre-electoral manipulation of fiscal policies, 
deficit spending, or shifts in the composition of spending. Most importantly, our model finds 
that incumbents principally have an incentive to spend more on public goods if elections are

close even though these short-term investments are not efficient in the long term. And while 
they would do so by increasing the deficits (with re-balancing the budget after the election), 
they would even choose this strategy at the cost of long-term investments if the extent of 
fiscal transparency does not allow them to finance the provision of public goods with higher 
deficits. In other words, if elections are close and the governmental deficit is visible to voters, 
then governments tend to increase the provision of public goods – and consequently, their 
electoral prospects – by a redistribution of budget resources from long-term efficient 
investment to a short-term provision of public goods. The next section formalizes this 
intuition and provides a theoretical argument of strategic budgeteering. 
Political Cycles and Strategic Budgeteering 
Elections are costly. Not only for the losing party, but also for the incumbent who aims to 
provide more public goods in order to increase her chances to get re-elected. To improve the 
welfare of the electorate in the short-term she may choose between alternative fiscal 
strategies. Our model of strategic budgeteering is based on existing models of political 
business cycles in fiscal policies. Specifically, we draw from Alt and Lassen (2006a,b) and 
Drazen/Eslava (2005, 2006) who analyze different fiscal strategies (and their constraints) to 
increase public good provision before elections. From these insights, we develop an integrated 
formal theory of fiscal instruments in the pre-election period. Specifically, we assume that 
governments may pursue three alternative strategies. In order to increase the provision of 
public goods they can (a) abstain from pursuing opportunistic policies in the pre-electoral 
period, (b) increase deficit spending, and (c) redistribute spending from long-term efficient 
investments to the short-term provision of public goods.8 
8 
We distinguish between longterm and shortterm spending unlike Drazen and Eslava (2005) who separate targeted from non-targeted spending. We concur that this is a useful distinction but argue that both targeted and non-targeted spending are part of short-term public good provision before elections. We will extend the model in the future to allow for this distinction as well. 
10 

========11========

In order to understand the conditions under which governments choose one or the other 
alternative, we develop a standard political economy model in which opportunistic 
governments choose between these fiscal strategies in order to maximize their chances to get 
re-elected by rational and prospective voters (e.g. Romer 2001, Persson and Tabellini 2002).9 
Voters care about their expected well-being in the future and make their electoral choices 
based on their expected income in the time after the elections. Consequently, we have to 
compare the long-term implications of the alternative fiscal choices and consider a two period 
model where elections take place at the end of period 1. 
In our baseline model, we simply assume that opportunistic governments try to maximize the 
utility of a representative voter over the two periods.10 In the following, we thus first derive a 
voter utility function and then derive the government’s optimal fiscal strategies before 
elections. 
Fiscal Policies and Voter Welfare 
Voters gain utility from two sources. They may gain from private consumption, C, (as a result 
of higher private income) and from publicly provided goods, G.11 Thus, the voter’s income is 
defined by 
Y C G  
(1) 
For simplicity, and without any loss of generalizability, we define income in the first period to 
equal exactly 1, y 
t 
 1 .12 
9 
Our baseline model assumes a closed economy but extensions to the baseline model that allow for influences of capital mobility and exchange-rate policy are in principle possible and desirable. 
10 
Further extensions to the baseline model will include policy makers with ideological preferences. Introducing ideology will allow for targeted partisan, sectoral and regional budgeteering. 
11 
Since voters are only interested in consumption, we disregard all possibilities of private investment and saving. Adding these features to the model is possible but would not change the main conclusions. 
12 
Alternatively, we may define a neoclassical or endogenous production function, 
Y AK L 
 1  
t 
, where Y is the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), A is Productivity, K is Capital, and L denotes Labor. This solution would be more elegant but it is much less parsimonious and does not provide additional information for our model. 
11 

========12========

In the first period, government spending (Gt) is financed by a fixed lump-sum tax rate . 
Alternatively, incumbents can increase public spending by creating a deficit (Dt) in period 1. 
Hence, the budget constraint is given by 
G Y Dt t t  , (2) 
and for private consumption it directly follows that 
C Yt t1  . (3) 
Equation (3) shows that the voters’ welfare declines in period 1 if the incumbent raises taxes 
to pursue expansionary fiscal policies in the period before elections. Consequently, 
incumbents are usually attracted to increase deficits in the pre-election period if possible 
because an increase in taxes in period 1 would result in declining political support during 
elections. Despite the relative attractiveness of deficits, we assume that the government has to 
balance the budget over the two periods. If governments decide to use deficit spending for 
public good provision in period 1, they have to increase revenues in the second period in order 
to balance the budget. Thus, 
D D D Dt t t t  
1 1 
 
 
 0 , (4) 
where Dtdenotes the budget deficit in period 1 and Dt+1 is the budget deficit in period 2. 
So far (and in line with most of the literature cited above), we simply assumed that 
governments have an incentive to increase spending before elections and that they either 
increase deficits or taxes to do so. However, we have not taken into account that incumbents 
typically have a choice between different spending items. Public budgets are divided into 
many different budget items (such as defense, social security, education, etc.) and 
governments may choose to increase or decrease spending on either of them. In the following, 
we thus assume that governments may principally raise expenditures on two different types of 
12 

========13========

public goods – long-term efficient investment (Lt) and/or short-term efficient public goods 
(Pt): 
G L Pt t t  .  (5) 
On one hand, they may increase long-term efficient investment (Lt). This does not have a 
direct positive effect in period 1 but it increases future (post-election) income by a growth 
parameter  : 
Y Y Lt t t1   
(6) 
Consequently, real private consumption also increases in the period after the election by long- 
term efficient government consumption. On the other hand, incumbents can increase 
expenditure on inefficient short-term public good provision (Pt ) which is purely consumptive 
and only has an effect in period 1. Examples of such short-term policies are labor market 
programs, social security spending, or other social transfer payments. However, although 
long-term investments have a positive effect in the second period, only the provision of short- 
term public goods has an immediate effect before the election. In other words, voters generate 
utility in period 1 only from private consumption and short-term public goods, but not from 
public investment that generates growth in the long-run: 
U C Pit t t  
(7) 
From this follows that governments can increase the voters’ welfare directly before elections 
by providing more short-term efficient public goods in period 1. They have a strong incentive 
to do so since this increases their probability of being re-elected. 
In her incentive to increase transfer payments before elections, however, the incumbent is 
restricted by her budget constraint. For example, the incumbent can increase the deficit to 
provide more public goods. Yet, the government budget has to be balanced over the two 
13 

========14========

periods, and thus, the deficit incurred in period 1 has to be paid back fully in period 2 plus an 
interest of size r (r>0). This has important implications for future consumption: 
C Y L r Dt t t t 
1 
1 1       
(8) 
If incumbents electioneer in period 1, then consumption declines in the period after elections 
(period 2) because the government has to increase revenues in order to re-balance the budget. 
Given those negative effects, we assume that governments only create deficits in order to 
finance short-term public goods that help to increase the probability of re-election. 
The diverging long-term effects of the two different policies – long versus short term 
spending – create a new opportunity for the government. Even if incumbents could not rely on 
deficit spending in period 1 for whatever reason, they may reduce long-term efficient 
investment (Lt) in order to provide more public goods (Pt). In other words, allowing for 
different types of goods creates an environment in which incumbents may choose between 
three policy instruments to increase their chances of re-election: they can either (a) do 
nothing, (b) increase deficit spending (Dt) in order to provide more public goods (Pt) in period 
1, or (c) increase short-term provision of public goods (Pt) by redistributing resources from 
long-term efficient investments (Lt).13 
Rational, prospective voters aim to take this into account when calculating their utility (ui) 
before elections. Most importantly, their utility from voting for the incumbent depends on 
their utility in period 1 (which is just the sum of private consumption and public goods) and 
the expected utility in period 2. While they can directly observe utility in period 1, 
consumption in period 2 is discounted by a factor  , 
 
 10 , and not fully anticipated by 
voters, but only expected: 
U C P Cit ,t t t t1 1     
 
 , (9) 
13 
Recall, they could also raise taxes. As discussed above, however, governments are less attracted to this fiscal policy instrument since voters observe a direct decline in their welfare and would punish the incumbent during elections. 
14 

========15========

where E stands for the expectation term. We take the logarithm of the contemporary and 
future consumption. This ensures a positive but decreasing utility function without generating 
a loss of generality (see Romer 2001, pp. 177-78). Accordingly, equation (9) simply turns into 
U ln C P ln Cit ,t t t t1 1     
 
  
 
. (10) 
Whether expected consumption in period 2 approaches actual consumption in period 1 
depends on two factors. First, voters expect a higher future well-being the higher the growth 
rate  (0< <1) which determines the effect of long-term government investment on future 
consumption. 
At the same time, they expect lower future well-being the higher the public deficit incurred by 
the government in period 1. However, voters cannot always observe distortive policies of the 
government. How well voters can observe debt-creation by the government depends on how 
transparent the fiscal system is (e.g. Alt/Lassen 2006a, b).14 Fiscal transparency is defined as 
“public openness about the structure and functions of government, fiscal policy intentions, 
public sector accounts, and projections. It involves ready access to reliable, comprehensive, 
timely, understandable, and internationally comparable information on government activities 
(…) so that the electorate and financial markets can accurately assess the government’s 
financial position and the true costs and benefits of government activities, including their 
present and future economic and social implications” (Kopits and Craig 1998, 1). 
In other words, fiscal transparency determines the visibility of debt-creation by the 
government and indicates the need to re-balance the budget in the period after elections. If 
deficit-creation is perfectly visible, voters know that the full amount of deficit generated in the 
first period must be compensated for in the second period and fully decreases consumption in 
14 
Note, since we assume that our incumbents are elected, we do not need to take into account the quality of democratic institutions to measure the visibility of governmental fiscal policies (e.g. Shi and Svensson 2000, 2002, 2006). However, both – fiscal transparency and democratic quality – have the same notion as they measure the extent to which governmental debt-creation is visible.

the second period. If deficit spending is not observable, then governments can use deficits to 
finance short-term public goods since this does not enter voters' utility calculation. 
Note, fiscal transparency mainly has an impact on whether voters can observe deficit 
spending by the government. Accordingly, fiscal transparency has a larger impact on the 
relationship between deficit spending and the voters’ expected welfare in the second period 
than on the relationship between strategic budgeteering and voter welfare. This assumption 
finds support in the fact that e.g. the media and opposition parties mainly use deficit-creation 
of the incumbent government to point out her incompetence in the political competition. 
Empirical research shows that voters perceive large deficits as signal that the economy is not 
doing well and tend to punish the incumbent for bad economic policy outcomes (see FN 3). 
The same pattern has not been observed for incumbents who increase short-term transfers in 
the year before elections. Finally note, however, that the voters’ utility at least implicitly 
decreases if governments refer to strategic budgeteering because this decreases the expected 
consumption in period 2. 
Both factors, the growth rate ( ) and fiscal transparency ( , 0 1  ) have an important 
effect on the voter’s expected utility from voting for the incumbent government. Including 
them, the expected consumption in period 2 is

Recall, above we assumed that the government faces two budget constraints. On one hand the 
policy maker can use tax revenue to finance both long-term efficient and short-term 
inefficient public goods. On the other hand governments also can create deficits to provide 
short-term public goods before elections. However, since the budget must be balanced over 
the two periods, it doesn't make sense for the government to use deficit spending on long-term

deficits as well:

(14) 
The two budget constraints show that inefficient public goods (Pt) which only serve 
opportunistic goals are mainly financed by deficits if transparency is low (e.g., if  
 0). If 
transparency is high (e.g., if  
1), only tax revenue can be used to provide these types of 
public goods. Alternatively, governments can decrease spending in long-term efficient 
policies in order to increase short-term provision of public goods (see equation 13). As above, 
we can assume that governments are more likely attracted to the latter since taxes cause a 
direct decline in the voters’ welfare before elections. 
Optimal Fiscal Strategies in the Pre-election Period 
The incumbent (who maximizes voter support) has to maximize the aggregated utility of 
individuals under its own budget constraints. We assume, however, that governments have a 
higher incentive to invest in inefficient short-term public goods if elections are much 
contested and the ex ante – perceived by the incumbent – probability to win the election is 
relatively low. The Lagrangian then is:

where  measures the ex-ante probability of winning the election (0< <1).  and  are the 
Lagrange multipliers and describe the budget constraints under which the government has to 
maximize voter utility over the two periods. 
From the above equations we can derive the first order conditions for optimal deficit 
spending, long-term government investment and short-term public good provision.

These equations for optimal policy choices of deficit, short-term public good provision and 
long-term government investment do note only show the conditions under which each single 
strategy is optimal but also indicate how governments choose between alternative fiscal 
instruments.15 
Predictions of the Model and Extensions 
We can derive several important predictions from the theoretical model. Most importantly, 
opportunistic governments have an incentive to increase the voters’ welfare before elections 
in order to maximize their chances to get re-elected. In doing so, they aim to increase the 
short-term provision of public goods particularly if elections are close. These policies come at 
a prize, however. Incumbents need to increase the budget deficits before elections if they want 
to expand public expenditures to gain political support. However, fiscally conservative voters 
punish distortive policies and would withdraw their political support if deficits are visible. 
The model then predicts that deficit spending declines with higher fiscal transparency and 
higher interest rates. Fiscal transparency constrains the government’s ability to manipulate the 
electoral business cycle. 
Yet, incumbents still aim to electioneer – especially if the elections are close. The declining 
opportunity to use deficit spending thus increases the government’s incentive to refer to other 
strategies such as a redistribution of government resources from long-term efficient 
investments towards short-term efficient public goods. Even though higher fiscal transparency 
also reduces the ability of policy makers to shift large parts of the budget from long term 
efficient investment to short term beneficial public goods, governments do so especially if 
elections are close. Along these lines, the model predicts that long-term investment declines if 
the probability of re-election is small and fiscal institutions are transparent (but at a lower rate 
the higher fiscal transparency). At the same time, short-term public good provision also 
declines with transparency, but at a much lower rate than long-term investment. 
15 
Since it is hard to interpret equation 23, in an earlier paper we simulate the comparative statics of the model and give a detailed derivation of the model predictions. 
19 

========20========

In other words, the instrument of deficit spending seems to be the most valuable for 
governments if fiscal transparency is low as it allows the government to finance additional 
public goods without decreasing long-term efficient investments. Fiscal transparency reduces 
the incumbent’s incentive to pursue distortive policies. However, while she cannot provide as 
many public goods as in the case of fiscal non-transparency, the incumbent can redirect some 
budget resources from long-term efficient investments away to short-term beneficial projects. 
Note, however, that this is less likely the more transparent the fiscal institutions. Thus, 
increases in public goods are always higher when fiscal transparency is low. 
Empirical Investigation of Strategic Budgeteering 
In the following we attempt to put the predictions of the theoretical model to the test. We use 
new data on the composition of public expenditure for 17 OECD countries over 35 years.16 
The data provides information on 23 spending categories ranging from expenditure for 
defense, public order and safety to education, social security and welfare, agriculture, mining 
and manufacturing, as well as infrastructure such as roads and railways. Table 1 describes all 
items in more detail. We employ both total expenditure and relative expenditure per item as 
the dependent variable. 
In order to test the hypothesis on strategic reshuffling from long-term efficient to short-term 
beneficial public spending in pre-election periods, we have to decide which items rather 
constitute long-term efficient and which short-term strategic public goods. The last column of 
table 1 shows our allocation which relies heavily on the categorization provided by Drazen 
and Eslava (2005) and we also consider work on German partisan spending preferences 
(Bawn 1999, Koenig / Troeger 2005). We only allocated the most obvious items and exclude 
the residual category from the empirical analysis. Drazen and Eslava (2005) mostly 
16 
The 17 countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, france, Germany, Iceland (not for all models), Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the US. The data collection was funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG). 
20

distinguish spending items with respect to targeted and non-targeted spending. We argue that 
both targeted (e.g. sectoral, regional) spending and non-targeted spending, especially social 
security transfers can be used in the short term to manipulate electoral behavior. We therefore 
find it more plausible to distinguish long-term efficient investment from short-term inefficient 
public good provision either to the median voter or targeted groups. Admittedly the 
assignment of items to a long-term and a short-term category is still pretty ad hoc and needs 
more theoretical derivation. Yet, for a first empirical investigation this allocation seems to 
provide us with relatively robust and consistent results. The assignment of items to long-term 
efficient and short-term beneficial public spending allows testing the first prediction on 
strategic budgeteering that incumbents tend to reshuffle resources from efficient investment to 
inefficient public good provision before elections in order to increase their chances staying in 
office. To determine the pre-election period we simply generate a dummy that takes the value 
one for the 24 month prior to a legislative election and zero otherwise. The data comes from 
the Database of Political Institutions (DPI) of the World Bank (Keefer 2004).17

We experimented with one pre-election year with no substantive changes to the main estimation results. For a better operationalization of the pre-electoral period and a more detailed discussion see Franzese (2002, 2003)

The theoretical model also predicts that strategic reshuffling of resources depends on the 
fiscal transparency of the country and the ex ante probability of winning an election (the 
closeness of the electoral competition). We operationalize the first condition by using the 
fiscal transparency index provided by Alt and Lassen (2005) which is based on a 1999 OECD 
questionnaire sent to all Budget Directors of OECD member countries. The main problem of 
the variable consists in its time invariance. Thus this argument only can be tested in a purely 
cross-sectional manner.18 Basically, we argue that in more fiscally transparent countries, 
incumbents cannot easily use deficits to provide public goods before elections but have to 
reshuffle the budget from long-term efficient to short-term beneficial spending. Thus, high 
transparency should make strategic budgeteering more likely. The second condition – 
closeness of elections – states that governments only resort to heavy budgeteering if the 
18 
However, this measure comes closest to our theoretical definition of fiscal transparency. For future research, alternative measures for transparency have to be constructed. Since we use country dummies in all our models, we use interaction effects with long- and short-term items as well as election periods to identify the effect of transparency. 
22 

========23========

elections are highly contested. To capture this factor we use a variable provided by the DPI 
(2004) which measures the margin of the majority by dividing the number of seats won by the 
largest government party by the total number of seats (government plus opposition plus non- 
aligned). Thus the larger value of the variable the less contested the elections are. Of course, 
this operationalization cannot capture situations of unexpected landslide victories but comes 
very close to our theoretical definition.19 
We conduct the empirical analysis in two steps. First we run models for alternative strategies 
to reshuffling the budget such as relaxing monetary policy, debt creation, and tax reduction. In 
a second step we estimate the extent of strategic budgeteering depending on the two 
conditions (transparency and closeness of elections) as well as controlling for alternative 
strategies. We also test for partisan effects but do not exhaustively cover this question and 
leave it for future research. 
Electoral Business Cycles without Strategic Budgeteering 
In a first stage we examine whether governments in OECD countries use strategic measures 
before elections in order to increase their odds of being re-elected. We look at debt creation 
(debt per GDP, OECD), monetary policy and monetary outcomes (interest rate and inflation – 
both WDI), and taxation (consumption tax revenue – OECD, average effective tax rates on 
capital and labor – own calculations, see Troeger 2008). We regress these instruments on the 
pre-election period, transparency and their interaction. We control for the unemployment rate 
and GDP per capita (both WDI), left and right cabinet portfolios (both DPI), the electoral 
system (1 – majoritarian, 0 – proportional, DPI) and Checks and Balances to the executive20 
(DPI). Since the theoretical model predicts an impact of interest rates on the ability of policy 
19 
It is always problematic to use ex post outcome data to model ex ante expectations. In future iterations of the 
paper we will use survey data on pre-electoral preferences to operationalize the incumbents ex ante 
expectation of winning the election. 
20 
We use different measures for veto players/ points, and institutional constraints to the executive with 
essentially the same statistical results. 
23 

========24========

makers to create higher deficits we include the main lending rate (OECD) to the right-hand- 
side of the debt ratio equation. We also add a dummy for EMU members that adopted the 
Maastricht criteria in order to test for the effect of stricter constraints to deficit spending and 
debt creation for those governments. 
We employ the fixed effects vector decomposition method suggested by Plümper and Troeger 
(2007) since the transparency measure is time invariant and the electoral system is slow 
moving at best, but certainly cross-sectionally dominant. This allows us to keep the beneficial 
characteristics of the fixed effects estimator for all time varying right-hand-side variables but 
still efficiently estimate coefficients for transparency and electoral system. We also employ a 
Prais-Winston transformation to eliminate existing serial correlation.21 Table 2 depicts the 
estimation results. 
The most interesting (for our purpose) conclusion is that we cannot find any business cycle or 
at least pre-electoral activity for taxation or monetary policy which corresponds to our 
theoretical discussion. Only for debt creation we can observe that governments on average 
increase the debt prior to elections in order to provide public goods that serve their electoral 
chances. Yet, in more fiscally transparent countries, incumbents are less likely to use debt 
creation for electoral purposes – the electoral business cycle becomes flatter. This finding 
supports the first hypothesis of our theoretical model: incumbents in fiscally transparent 
systems are less likely to use deficit spending prior to elections in order to increase their 
probability of being re-elected. In addition we find that higher interest rates indeed reduce 
deficit spending in general since debt services become more expensive. Also, as expected 
EMU members have lower debt ratios on average. 
21 
We are painfully aware of all the endogeneity and simultaneity issues of this approach. It would certainly be better to estimate a simultaneous equation model. Yet, our most important results do not change.

In the next section we analyze whether governments are in turn more likely to reshuffle the 
budget for electoral purposes. 
Electoral Business Cycles and Strategic Budgeteering 
If governments cannot create debt, do they strategically reshuffle the budget from long-term 
efficient investment to short-term beneficial public goods in order to improve their electoral 
prospects? This section tries to empirically answer the question. Since our dependent variable 
is a composite of different budget items, efficiency issues due to substitution effects arise. We 
have yet to find a suitable way to address these issues in a satisfactory manner. However, this 
25 

========26========

model exactly estimates possible substitution effects between long-term efficient investments 
and short-term public goods because it only includes these budget items into the model. We 
use dummy variables for these two categories and interact these with the most important 
theoretical variables. We are aware that this approach does not account for any other 
substitution effects between single spending items but we are confident that the empirical 
results give us some insights into the mechanisms of strategic budgeteering. To further 
address substitution issues we use both relative expenditure per item as well as total 
expenditure per item (with overall spending on the RHS of the model capturing the budget 
constraint) and compare the results.22 The data structure is three-dimensional: spending item 
per country per year (15*17*35). Spending data are consistently available for about 13 
spending categories which leaves us with about 7735 observations from which we can use 
5000-6000 observations for 16-17 countries due to missing data for some of the institutional 
variables especially before 1980. We use other budgeteering measures (debt, monetary policy 
and taxation) and the same political and institutional variables as in the first stage models as 
control variables. 
We include country dummies into all models so that the level effect of transparency is soaked 
up by the country effects. We still can identify the pre-electoral effect of fiscal transparency 
which is sufficient for the test of our hypothesis. We again employ a Prais-Winston 
transformation to control for existent serial correlation. This specification is also useful since 
we are interested in short-term adjustment effects in spending. 
The results presented in Table 3 test the argument that governments reshuffle resources from 
long-term investment to short-term public goods before elections and whether this is 
conditional on fiscal transparency. The model fit is reasonably good for total expenditure but 
poor for relative expenditure which is to be expected due to the high share of pre-determined 
spending. Still all models in table 3 support our prediction that governments indeed engage in 
22 
We also use yearly changes in spending per item with mostly the same findings, yet significance levels drop. 
26 

========27========

strategic budgeteering before elections. Long-term efficient investment is reduced in the pre- 
electoral period and more money is spent on short-term public goods, especially social 
security, manufacturing and other sectoral subsidies. In addition, fiscal transparency dampens 
the electoral cycle and incumbents in more transparent countries are less likely to reshuffle 
the budget before elections but invest in long-term efficient projects such as infrastructure and 
education. These findings are robust throughout all models in table 3. Yet, the effect is not as 
strong as for deficit spending suggesting that even though fiscal transparency constrains 
electioneering ceteris paribus it has a smaller impact on strategic budgeteering. The more 
transparent a country the higher the probability that voters can see thru all kind of measures 
whose sole purpose is to manipulate the electoral business cycle.

In addition we check whether incumbents who are unable to use deficit spending for electoral 
purposed compensate by reshuffling more money across budgetary items. Yet, the results 
remain inconclusive since the estimates turn out statistically insignificant. If anything it seems 
that governments who use deficit spending before elections also have a higher propensity to 
engage in strategic budgeteering which would support the results found with respect to 
transparency. 
Most of the control variables do not exert a significant effect on overall spending, just 
inflation and capital taxation lead to higher expenditure on all spending items.

The models in table 4 test for the second condition – the closeness of election as well as some 
partisan budgeteering. We interact pre-electoral long- and short-term spending with the 
margin of the majority and expect that the smaller the margin the higher the propensity for 
redirecting resources from long-term investment to short-term electoral gifts. And we find 
exactly this: the more contested the elections the more money is reshuffled. The larger the 
margin the smaller the need for the incumbent to engage in strategic budgeteering and thus the 
positive sign for long-term spending and negative coefficient estimates for short-term 
expenditure. The signs are consistent throughout all models but the coefficients only turn out 
to be significant for the effect on long-term spending. The findings for pre-electoral 
reshuffling and transparency remain stable throughout all models. 
Finally, we test some partisan hypotheses. Based on predictions by Bawn (1999) and Koenig 
and Troeger (2005) we chose the most obvious partisan items for right-wing and left-wing 
parties – military (defense) spending and social security & welfare spending. We also 
examine whether governments increase social security spending before elections in case the 
economy does badly – the unemployment rate is high. The results are shown in the bottom 
right corner of table 4 (Model 3e and 3f, grey shaded area). The findings are strong and as 
expected. Left-wing incumbents spend more on social welfare before elections and right-wing 
incumbents increase expenditure on defense issues before elections in order to cater to their 
specific constituency. Independent of partisanship governments increase pre-electoral welfare 
spending in case the unemployment rate is high.

Conclusion 
The literature on political business cycles in fiscal policies has come a long way. Most 
importantly, scholars have highlighted different fiscal strategies which are used by 
incumbents to increase the voters’ well-being before elections. Additionally, they have 
investigated into the constraints governments face particularly when employing deficit 
spending in the pre-election period. They thereby elucidate the conditions under which deficit 
spending as a strategy to win re-election is effective. 
Based on the insights of these models which analyze different strategies in isolation, this 
paper developed an integrated formal model of fiscal strategies in the pre-election period. 
Most importantly, we analyzed how opportunistic incumbents choose between different fiscal 
strategies, such as deficit spending and strategic budgeteering, to increase their electoral 
prospect in the period before the election takes place. One of our main departures from the 
literature was that we assumed that governments may either spend on long-term efficient 
investment or short-term efficient public good provision. They increase public good provision 
in the pre-election period by either raising deficits or by redirecting resources from long-term 
efficient investments to short-term efficient public goods. 
We find that governments principally have an incentive to increase short-term public good 
provisions if they fear fierce electoral competition and small chances of getting re-elected. To 
finance these opportunistic policies, governments increase the deficit in the pre-election 
period. Deficit spending becomes less attractive if fiscal transparency is high (and 
consequently, fiscally conservative voters would be able to observe the distortive policies of 
the government) and interest rates rise. The incumbent then faces a trade off between short- 
term public good provision and long-term efficient investment. Because they cannot use 
deficit spending under fiscal transparency, governments tend to change the composition of the 
budget if elections are close. Strategic budgeteering goes at the expense of long-term efficient 
31 

========32========

investments. In other words, long-term efficient fiscal policies are less likely the higher fiscal 
transparency and the smaller the probability that the incumbent gets re-elected. 
In a way of summarizing, the model presented here elucidates under which governments 
either rely on deficit spending or the redistribution of budget resources – what we call 
strategic budgeteering – in order to increase the voters’ welfare in the period before elections. 
The model offers a parsimonious account of opportunistic governmental strategies. It thereby 
provides the basis for several important extensions. First of all, governments do not only face 
a trade off when choosing alternative fiscal policies. Under certain conditions – e.g. if 
exchange rates are flexible or central bank independence low – monetary policy instruments 
become effective leaving fiscal strategies ineffective. An important extension of our model 
would thus include the possibility to use monetary policies to generate political business 
cycles. 
Additionally, we have neither considered partisan preferences nor different forms of strategic 
budgeteering in our baseline model. However, we expect that different political parties would 
serve different voters, and thus increase spending on different budget items or have different 
preferences of raising the deficit. This is directly linked to different forms of re-distributing 
the budget. While our baseline model simply assumes that governments choose between long- 
term efficient investment and short-term efficient public goods, redistribution could take 
several forms. In an extension to the baseline model, it would be thus important to distinguish 
between, for example, (a) functional, (b) sectoral, and (c) regional budgeteering. 
The empirical analysis supports most of our predictions, governments engage in strategic 
budgeteering and they do so the more contested the elections are. However, fiscal 
transparency seems to reduce all activities that aim at manipulating the electotral business 
cycle. Moreover, we found some support for partisan budgeteering. 
The empirical models however need to better take substitution effects as well as simultaneity 
and endogeneity issues into account.
