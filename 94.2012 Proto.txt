Abstract: Determining the relation between life satisfaction and aggregate income at country level has been problematic, because cross-country and times-series analysis generally give dit conclusions. Here we analyze this relation without imposing any polynomial structure to the estimated model and eliminating potentially confounding country-speci fac- tors. We show the existence of a bliss point in the interval between 26,000$ and 30,000$ (2005 in PPP) in relationship between individual life satisfaction and GDP. An almost identical re- sult is found when the relationship between aggregate income of Western European regions and life satisfaction of their residents is analyzed: in this case, data suggest a bliss point be- tween 30,000$ and 33,000$. In both samples, we   evidence of a decreasing level of life satisfaction after the bliss points. Therefore, the analysis overall shows the existence of an hump-shaped pattern between GDP and life satisfaction. 
We discuss possible explanations of the hump-shaped pattern linked to external e of the aggregate income on life satisfaction due, for example, to habit formation and income comparison and present an econometric test of this potential explanation based on some recent  of the e-factor personality theory.

1 Introduction 
At present, welfare of nations is measured indirectly: Gross Domestic Product is used 
to asses the aggregate development of a country. Subjective and self-reported measures 
have traditionally been considered unreliable among economists. However, from a med- 
ical point of view, growing evidence points to a robust correlation between answers to 
subjective well-being questions and objective measures of personal well-being.1 Further- 
more, an important piece of empirical evidence, comparing explicit indexes of well being, 
has been recently provided by Oswald and Wu (2010) showing for the US a state-by-state 
remarkably precise match between classical objective measure (like air quality, climate, 
etc.) of well-being and subjective measure. Thus, even if prone to idiosyncratic dis- 
tortions, subjective measures correlate with objective measures, so their signi is 
supported. 
Perhaps because of these considerations, the Commission on the measurement of 
economic performance and social progress created at the beginning of 2008 on French 
government’s initiative, and formed by a distinguished group of social scientists, put 
subjective well-being into the limelight as a possible supplement to traditional measures 
of development such as GDP (Stiglitz et al., 2009). Also the British government as 
shown considerable interest in developing subjective wellbeing measure in recent years 
as an instrument for policy (e.g. Michealson et al., 2008).2 
The debate on whether GDP growth increases happiness, or more precisely whether 
higher income in a country is associated in general with higher life satisfaction among 
the citizens is considered of crucial importance for scienti and for policy reasons. For 
1See Clark et al. (2008) for an extensive survey on this literature. 
2Key milestones include the Local Government Act 2000 giving power to Local Authorities to promote social wellbeing, publication of the Prime Ministers Strategy Unit paper Life Satisfaction: The state of knowledge and implications for Government in 2002 and the UK Sustainable Development Strategy which committed the Government to exploring the policy implications of wellbeing research (Waldron, 2010).

example, if one thinks that the answer is fundamentally positive, then there is no need 
for alternative measures of the wealth of a nation, and traditional values gross domestic 
product measures su If the answer is no, then there is a fundamental need to 
re-evaluate what public policies take as objective. 
The scienti debate on the relation between Gross Domestic Product and self re- 
ported indices of life satisfaction is still open. In a well-known  Easterlin reported 
no signit relationship between happiness and aggregate income in time-series anal- 
ysis. For example, the income per capita in the USA in the period 1974-2004 almost 
doubled, but the average level of happiness shows no appreciable trend upwards. This 
puzzling g, appropriately called the Easterlin Paradox (Easterlin, 1974) has been 
con in similar studies by psychologists (Diener et al., 1995) and political scientists 
(Inglehart, 1990), and for European countries, Easterlin (1995).3 
Life satisfaction appears to be monotonically increasing with income when one studies 
this relation at a point in time across nations (Inglehart, 1990; Deaton, 2008; Stevenson 
and Wolfers, 2008). It has been suggested that a way to reconcile the cross-sectional 
evidence with the Easterlin’s Paradox is that the positive gradient in happiness disap- 
pears after a certain bliss point (Layard, 2005; Inglehart, 1990; Inglehart et al., 2008; di 
Tella et al., 2010). This last interpretation has been questioned by Deaton (2008) and 
Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) who claim that there is a positive gradient between GDP 
and life satisfaction in developed countries and, from the opposite perspective, by East- 
erlin et al. (2010), who provide some evidence of no long-run e even for developing 
countries. 
We perform our analysis without imposing a particular functional form to the econo- 
metric model. We partition all individuals’ observations in dit quantiles according

to per capita GDP of the country of residence. Therefore, the 1st quantile of the distribu- 
tion contain the fraction of individuals living in the poorest country, and the last quantile 
a similar fraction of individuals leaving in the richest countries. We initially consider a 
partition in 15 quantiles, but then we repeat the analysis for 30 and 50 quantiles parti- 
tions. Estimating the impact of each dummy variable, indicating the dit quantiles, 
on individuals’ life satisfaction we  in the 15 quantiles analysis, an increasing coef- 
t until the 12th quantile, then coet seem to decrease to become statistically 
smaller in the 15th quantile. A similar analysis is performed for the European regions, 
with the only di that individuals are subdivided in 5 quintiles and 10 quantiles: 
the coarser grid is chosen because of the smaller variance in the regional GDP. 
The above  imply a non monotonic pattern between GDP and individuals life 
satisfaction, consistent with a hump-shaped relation with a bliss point in the interval 
between 26,000 and 30,000 2005 USD, in PPP. We also  a positive relation between 
aggregate income and life satisfaction across poorer countries: this relation seems to 
turn negative in richer countries. Most of the variation of life satisfaction due to GDP 
is explained by the e in countries with per capita GDP below 10,000 USD. The 
probability of reporting the highest level of life satisfaction is more than 10% lower in 
the poor countries with a GDP below 5,600 USD than in the richest counties with a 
GDP above 36,600 USD. For counties with an income above 10,000 USD the probability 
of reporting the highest level of life satisfaction changes within a range of 3% maximum. 
This pattern is robust to the introduction of a number of demographic and occupational 
controls and to the year  e 
Our  are not in contrast with the previous cross sectional analysis. The 
di with this literature are easily explained by the method we use: in fact our 
data replicate results in the cross-country based literature when similar methods are 
used. For example, we will see that when one uses all countries and waves in the World 
4 

========5========

Value Survey, data show a monotonic relation between GDP and life satisfaction if we 
do not introduce country-speci dummies. Similarly, our  are not in contrast 
with the previous times-series based analysis, mostly focused on developed countries, 
but it allows to pool data to an extent which is larger than what is allowed by separate 
times-series analysis at country level. 
The possibility of controlling for the country speci e makes it possible to con- 
trol for time-invariant country-speci unobservable variables, therefore eliminating a 
potential source of country-speci measurement errors and omitted-variable bias. In- 
troducing this control is an element of crucial importance for analysis based on survey, 
because the questionnaires are generally dit across countries and there are pervasive 
e due to culture or language and social capital. Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) and 
Sacks et al. (2010) estimated the e of life satisfaction over GDP, using the WVS and 
controlling for country e but they impose a logarithm structure to the model. 
Measurement errors of life satisfaction indices are various: for example, a well known 
error is the ditial item functioning, de as the inter-personal and inter-cultural 
variation in interpreting and using the response categories for the same question (Hol- 
land and Wainer, 1993).4 
If this ditial item functioning generates a systematic 
measurement error in the life satisfaction reports, this could lead to either a positive or 
negative bias depending on the correlation between the measurement error and other 
variables in the regression. For example, if Western countries tend to over-report their 
life satisfaction, this could generate a positive bias in cross-country estimates of the im- 
pact of Income on life satisfaction. Omitted-variable bias could be equally problematic. 
For example, if cultural elements determine a time invariant preference for public good 
supply in some country, or if income distribution { usually very persistent in time{ is 
4Angelini et al. (2009) and Bonsang and van Soest (2010) using vignettes to correct for Individual- Speci Scale Biases show that variations in response scales explain a large part of the cross European country dirences found in raw data.

correlated with both life satisfaction and GDP, this would result in a bias in the relation 
between GDP and life satisfaction. Controlling for country speci e eliminates all 
biases than could be generated by the time invariant unobservables mentioned in the 
examples.5 
To further validate this result we conduct a cross sectional analysis on more homo- 
geneous territorial units, and consider all regions in the European Union before the  
enlargement (we will refer to this group of country as EU14) to eliminate potentially 
confounding factors at country level. As expected, we obtain similar non monotonicity 
in the relation between individual life satisfaction and regional GDP, without controlling 
for regional or country e Data show a positive relation between aggregate income 
and life satisfaction across poorer regions, and then this relation turns negative for richer 
regions with a bliss point between 30,000 and 33,000 2005 USD in PPP. 
The existence of a non monotonic relation for rich countries provides important in- 
sight in the analysis of the determinant of individual life satisfaction. Accordingly, in the 
last main section of the paper we investigate the reason of the non monotonic relation 
emphasized by our results. It is known that life satisfaction is increasing in personal 
income at a decreasing rate (e.g. Blanchwer and Oswald, 2004; Layard et al., 2008; 
Kahneman and Deaton, 2010). However, considering the relation between GDP and life 
satisfaction, a considerable literature following the Easterlin paradox suggest that this 
link is complicated by the existence of other e acting with an opposite sign: (i) the 
aspirations adapt to the new situations, an idea originally proposed by Brickman and 
Campbell (1971);6 (ii) the e of the relative income on individual life satisfaction { 
the so-called \Keeping up with the Joneses" hypothesis{ an idea that can de dated back 
5Furthermore, the panel structure of the WVS o the possibility to include the year  that, together with individual employment status and personal income, allows to control for the main e of the short-run business cycles that it is well known to have an impact on life satisfaction (DiTella et al., 2001; Easterlin et al., 2010).

to Duesenberry (1949).7 
We will show with a simple example that if the relation between GDP and life satis- 
faction is the result of combined e of personal income, increasing aspiration and/or 
increasing target in terms of income comparison, the net e is not obviously mono- 
tonic. We test this possibility using the EU14 data and we  the usual positive e 
due to the personal income and a negative e due to the negative distance between 
personal income and regional GDP. Using modern personality theory we will argue that 
this second e can be related to the negative e induced by the distance from the 
target income. 
The paper is organized as it follows: in the next section we present the data. In 
section 3 we present the country based analysis. Section 4 is devoted to the region based 
analysis. In section 5 we discuss the possible reason for the non monotonic patterns 
emphasized above. Section 6 concludes. 
2 Data 
We use the World Value Survey (WVS) for both the country level and European regional 
analysis. In the WVS the variable used to measure personal satisfaction is the answer to 
the question: "All things considered, how satisd are you with your life as a whole these 
days?" coded on a scale from 1 (dissatis to 10 (satis The data are generally 
available for e waves: 1981-1984, 1989-93, 1994-99, 1999-04, 2005-08; we exclude few 
country-waves explicitly considered not representative in the WVS. Individuals in the 
sample are dit in each wave. From the WVS we will also consider the personal 
income measure, coded in 10 steps in the WVS dataset and considered comparable

across countries. Education, in term of age of leaving education, coded from 1 to 10, 
ranging from less than 12 until to more than 21. The categories for Employment status 
are: Full time, part time, self-employed, retired, housewife, student, unemployed, other. 
Town size is coded in 1 to 8 sizes, ranging from less than 2000 until 500,000 and more. 
The Country per capita GDP is from the World Bank World Development Indicators 
data-set, and they are in constant 2005 US international dollars PPP adjusted. In the 
paper we partition the observation in 15, 30 and 50 quantiles, according to the GDP data, 
the dit country/wave in the 15 quantiles partition are presented in the section A.1 
of the appendix. Table 2 provides a description of the main variables. 
In the second analysis we focus on the 14 European countries before the accession 
of the east European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, 
Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom) and 
consider the observation at regional levels. The European regions are de following 
the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS2) used by the EU; we have 
data for 171 regions. The regional per capita GDP data are from the Eurostat dataset; 
the values in Euros are Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted. We then transform 
the regional GDP data in constant 2005 USD using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of 
World Bank-World Development Indicators dataset.8 Table 1 provides a description of 
the main variables for the European region based analysis, while the list of the countries 
in each quantile for the 5 quantile partition is provided in section A.2 of the appendix. 
3 Country Based Analysis 
We perform the following analysis by using as main explanatory variables dummies 
indicating the dit quantiles of the per capita GDP distribution among countries. We

will show that the coet of the quantile dummies reveal a pattern of life satisfaction 
strongly increasing with GDP in low income countries, then it becomes much less steep 
after 10,000 USD and, interestingly enough, life satisfaction shows a tendency to decline 
with GDP for the richest countries. 
We start by partitioning all individual observations in 15 quantiles of about 21,000 
observations each.9 We estimate dit variations of the following model: 
satisfactioni;j;t = j + 1;zquantile(z)j;t + t +  Ki;j;t + ui;j;t 
(1) 
where i; j; t denotes the individual i, country j and period t respectively. The term 
quantile(z)j;t is a dummy variables equal to 1 if the country j at time t belongs to the 
quantile z and 0 otherwise; j are country dummies, t are period dummies, Ki;j;t is a 
vector of individual characteristics and ui;j;t is an error term. 
For expositional simplicity we will always consider last quintile, the one containing 
the richest countries, as the base to compare all other group and we will therefore omit 
it in all the speciions of model (1) that will follow. In order to take into account 
the ordinal nature of life satisfaction variable we use an ordered probit estimator, and 
to take into account the possible heteroscedasticity in the data we cluster the errors at 
wave and country level to calculate the standard errors. 
It is perhaps useful to note that the ordered probit estimator for this model is not 
inconsistent even if we are using country-speci dummies. The reason is that we are 
using individual data, this avoids the incidental parameters problem generated by the 
increase of parameters with the number of observations n following the introduction of 
the individuals’ xed e10 
In table 3 we present dit variations of the simplest speci of model (1), 
9The resulting GDP brackets of each quantile are in the horizontal axis of re 1 of the appendix and the county-wave combinations in each bracket are presented in section A.1 of the appendix.

without time dummies, t and the controls Ki;j;t. We will henceforth de this as the 
baseline speci Given that we use the last quantile as the base level, a posi- 
tive (negative) and signit coet implies a positive (negative) and signit 
ditial e on life satisfaction with respect to the last quantiles. Hence the ex- 
istence of positive and signit coets of any of the quantile dummies reveal a 
non monotonically-increasing pattern. In particular from column 1 of table 3, we note 
that the coets of the dit quantiles reveal a statistically signit non mono- 
tonic pattern. There is a signitly positive ditial e (i.e. the coets 
are negative and signit) between life satisfaction of individuals living in the richest 
countries (with a GDP larger than 38K 2005 USD in the 15th quantile) and individuals 
living in countries with less than about 10K USD (individuals in the 7th quantile and 
below). The coents are statistically non dint from 0 within the interval 11K 
and 25K (between quantile 7th and 11th), then they turn positive until the 14th quintile. 
Therefore, column 1 of table 3 suggest non monotonic relationship between GDP and 
life satisfaction . 
Table 1 presents the marginal e of the estimated model presented in the 1st 
column of table 3. The 1st column of table 1 shows the estimated marginal eects of the 
dit quantiles on the probability of declaring the highest level of life satisfaction, 10. 
The 2nd column shows the elasticities obtained by estimating an OLS model, therefore 
assuming a cardinal structure to the life satisfaction reports. In both cases we note 
that the peak in life satisfaction is achieved in the interval 26,500 - 29,900 USD (12th 
quantile), and that the dummies related to this interval is statistically larger than the 
baseline dummies (related the last quantile), this suggest the existence of an hump 
shaped pattern for rich countries. Individuals in the 12th quantile have about 2% more 
chance of declaring the highest level of satisfaction than individuals in the last quantile. 
Furthermore, we note that the probability of being fully satis is more than 10% lower

========11========

in the poor countries in the  3 quantiles than in the richest counties of the last 
quantile (ure 1 of the appendix plots the marginal e of the estimated quantile 
coets presented in table 1). 
These results are consistent with the result in column 4 of table 3, where we imposed 
a quadratic structure to the estimated model, whose interpolating line reach its peak 
at about 31K (statistically dit from the upper bound of 64K). Comparing the 1st 
with the 2nd column of table 3, we note that the relation between life satisfaction and 
country GDP seems monotonic when we do not include the country speci e this is 
consistent with the current literature (e.g. Deaton, 2008; Stevenson and Wolfers, 2009). 
In section A.1 of the appendix, we can observe the country wave combination belonging 
to the last quantile.11 The hump-shaped relation is robust to the exclusion of Singapore 
and Luxembourg, as we can see from the 3rd column of table 3. 
In table 5 we show the estimation results of a more complete speci of model 
(1). The non monotonic pattern holds when we introduce controls for year e and 
individual demographic (column 1) and education and employment status (column 2). 
Note that also the introduction of the personal income (in column 3) does not seem to 
change qualitatively the non monotonic relation between GDP and life satisfaction. It 
is therefore arguable that the relation between aggregate incomes and life satisfaction is 
due to external e In the last main section of the paper we will try to shed some 
light on the mechanisms generating this pattern. Finally note from the 4th column of 
table 5 that data are consistent with a quadratic model, where the interpolating line has 
a maximum at around 30K, similar to the one in column 4 of table 3.12 
In order to have a better description of the pattern governing the non monotonic

========12========

relation between GDP and life satisfaction, especially in the richest countries, and also to 
check the robustness of the above results, we estimate model (1) using smaller partitions 
and hence grouping the data in a larger number of quantiles. In table 6, we show 
the coets of the 30 quantiles in the baseline speci of model (1) and their 
con intervals, where errors are clustered at country and wave levels. We can 
therefore observe their statistical di from 0, the base coet indicating the 
30th quintile. All coecients between 21st and 28th quantiles are above the one in the 
30th. Also this pattern seems hump-shaped, with the coet increasing until the 23rd 
quantile{ corresponding to a GDP interval 25K-26K{ and then decreasing. 
A hump shaped pattern is also consistent with  1, where we partitioned the 
country-wave observations in 50 quintiles and we interpolate a cubic line. The quadratic 
and cubic coets of the interpolating line are both signit at 1 % level and, we 
can observe a maximum around the 40th quantile, corresponding to a GDP interval 
28.3K- 2.8.5K. In  2, we display only the coets of the 25 richest quantiles, 
corresponding to the top 50% GDP, and its quadratic interpolation with the 95 % con- 
 interval. We observe that the quadratic interpolation features a peak at around 
the 40th quantile; from a visual inspection of the  we note that a monotonic pattern 
within the 95 % con interval can be rejected. 
4 Region Based Analysis 
We showed that when one controls for country heterogeneity introducing a country spe- 
ci e life satisfaction is not monotonically increasing with GDP. In order to validate 
the former result we now analyze the relation between GDP and life satisfaction among 
more homogeneous territorial units. We restrict our selection to all countries belong- 
ing to the EU before the enlargement to the eastern European countries, we refer to 
12 

========13========

this group as EU14 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, 
Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom), in 
order to have more variation and observations we consider the data at regional level.13 
Given the higher level of homogeneity within the group of countries we are considering, 
we expect that a relation similar to the one we have seen holds for this selection, without 
controlling for country (or region) e 
In a similar way as before we group observations in 5 quantiles based on GDP for 
each region-wave, with about 6,500 observations per quantile in the 5 quantiles. Later we 
show similar results when we consider a partition in 10 quantiles. The list of region-wave 
per quantile are presented in section A.2 of the appendix. In table 7 we present the 
results, with data partitioned in 5 quantiles, as before the last quantile is the base one, 
and for this reason it has been omitted, given the small amount of observations in several 
regions we calculated the standard errors by clustering the errors at quantile levels. 
Column 1 of table 7 shows that life satisfaction invariably increases in the rst 4 
quintiles and decreases in the last. In this column{ consistently with to the logic of this 
second test{ we are not controlling for country, or regional heterogeneity. In column 2 
of table 7 we show that the result is robust to the introduction of country speci e 
In column 3 we introduce town sizes dummies to control for congestion, employment 
status, education and year  e Note that the year xed e is a particularly 
ee control for economic cycles given the high degree of economic integration among 
the European regions in the sample. Finally, in column 4 of table 7 we observe that 
the hump-shaped relation between regional GDP and life satisfaction is robust to the 
introduction of individual income. 
This non monotonic pattern can be observed from  3 as well. We aggregated all

waves for which the information on the regional residence and the data on the regional 
GDP are available, i.e. waves 1994-99, 1999-2004, 2005-08. The solid line in both panels 
of gure 3 represents the Lowess function, which displays for each value of the indepen- 
dent variable (Regional GDP) a smoothed value of the dependent variable (Average life 
satisfaction). The dotted lines are the quadratic interpolations. Both the linear and 
quadratic coecients of the quadratic interpolations are highly signit and consis- 
tent with a peak internal to the regional GDP intervals. Note that in the panel without 
outliers, the estimated Lowess function follows close the quadratic interpolation. 
Figure 3 may suggest that the declining segment of the curve is strongly determined 
by only two observations, Bruxelles and Paris. We repeated all regressions in table 7 
excluding these two observations: results are presented in table 8. From column 1 we 
note that the coet of the 4th quantile dummy is still signitly positive, although 
smaller in magnitude. Hence the non monotonic relation between regional GDP and life 
satisfaction is robust to this exclusion. In column 2 to 4 we added some more controls, 
 similar results (although in one case the coet of the 4th quantiles looses its 
statistical signi 
In table 9 we partition the regional data in 10 quantiles to check the robustness of 
the above results. From column 1 we note that there is an increasing positive e 
until the 7th quantile then the coets of the quantile dummies decrease. However 
this is true until the 9th quintile since the coet of the 9th quantile is negative, 
reversing the decreasing pattern. Column 2 and 3 show that this reversion at the last 
quantile disappear when we control for either town size or country ect (in the top 
panel of  3 of the appendix, we display the value of the coet of of the 10 
quantile dummy relative to the estimation of column 2). We note a pattern that seem 
monotonically increasing (apart for the exception of the 2nd quantile) until the 7th 
quantile then it is decreasing. This suggest an hump shaped pattern with a maximum in

the 7th quantile, corresponding to a regional GDP within the interval 30K-33K. Columns 
4 and 5  show that the hump-shaped pattern is robust to the introduction of a 
number of individual controls as in the previous table. 
In order to check how much of the above results are dependent from the outliers we 
observed in gure 3 , we repeated the analysis above, by excluding the 10th quantile 
(containing both Paris and Bruxelles) and using the 9th as base level. Results are 
displayed in table 10 (and in the bottom panel of  3 of the appendix), where we 
note a similar pattern than in the analysis with all 10 quantiles. A pattern generally 
increasing in the  7th quantile then decreasing. 
5 Explaining the non monotonic pattern 
What is the reason of the hump-shaped relation? It is well known that life satisfaction 
is increasing in personal income at a decreasing rate (e.g. Blanchwer and Oswald 
2004). Layard et al. (2008)  that the marginal life satisfaction with respect to 
income declines at a rate faster than the one implied by a logarithm utility function. 
This  is substantially supported by Kahneman and Deaton (2010) that, using 
USA data, argue that the e of income on the emotional dimension of well-being is 
strictly increasing until an annual income of 75,000 USD, but has no further positive 
in for higher values. 
There is however a signicant amount of evidence, mostly aimed at explaining the 
Easterlin paradox, suggesting that this link is complicated by the existence of other 
e One potential explanation of the paradox is that individuals adapt over time to 
new conditions, so the levels of subjective well-being tend to revert to a baseline level 
which may depend on a reference point, an idea originally proposed by Brickman and 
Campbell (1971). A natural reference point ia an aspiration level: hence to the extent 
15

that an increase in income leads to an increase in aspirations, changes in income may 
not have a long-run e on subjective well being. The use of aspiration to describe the 
relation between income and life satisfaction is also consistent with much of the existing 
psychological literature on happiness, and it can be linked to the widespread idea that 
levels of subjective well being tend to revert to baseline levels depending on subjective 
reference points: Headey et al. (2010) recently reassessed this idea.14 
A dit explanation of the Easterlin Paradox takes relative rather than absolute 
income as the relevant concept, an idea that can de dated back to Duesenberry (1949).15 
Increase in the aggregate GDP is likely to result in an increase in the personal income 
of the majority of the residents, but it also a individual aspirations and reference 
income. Therefore the relation between GDP and life satisfaction is possibly determined 
by dirent e acting in dit directions and there is no reason why the aggregate 
e should be monotonic. 
The following simple example can clarify the idea. Assume that individual life sat- 
isfaction is a increasing and concave function u(yi) of the personal income yi; moreover 
it also negatively depends on the di between personal income and target level yi, 
so that life satisfaction = u(yi) 
 v(yi 
 yi), where v is an increasing function. The value 
yi can ret the income of a reference group (i.e. the \Joneses"), or to an aspiration 
level for individual i. For expositional simplicity, assume that the majority of individuals 
have the same personal income, and let it be fraction, a  1 of the per capita GDP, y; 
and they have the same level of aspiration yi = by, with b > 1, so that the target income 
for most individuals is increasing with the GDP. Therefore, even if the personal income 
increases with the GDP, the level of life satisfaction can be non monotonic in the GDP, 
14Recent evidence provided by Benjamin et al. (2011) showed the negative e of high aspiration can also be rationally predicted by individuals that, nevertheless may still choose non-happiness maximizing options compatible with high income aspirations. 
15See Clark et al. (2008) for an extensive survey of the theoretical and empirical literature explaining the Easterlin Paradox.

y.16 
To check the existence of this e in our data, in table 12 we estimate a model, 
based on the EU14 regional data, where life satisfaction depends on the the logarithm of 
the personal income, the logarithm of the Regional GDP, the di between personal 
income and regional GDP, as well as other individual and country speci control vari- 
ables. 
17 
In the WVS, data on household income is expressed in 10 or 11 country-speci 
brackets, we derived the personal income by taking the middle value of each bracket then 
we transformed the data in 2005 USD PPP adjusted. The summary statistics of the de- 
rived personal income variable, in 10,000 USD, is presented in table 11. 
We introduce the di between personal income and regional GDP separately 
as a positive di (Income 
 Reg:GDP)+ (equal to 0 if Income < Reg:GDP) and 
negative di (Reg:GDP 
 Income)+ (equal to 0 if Income < Reg:GDP). The 
term (Reg:GDP 
 Income)+ is a proxy for the di y 
 y as de above. Given 
that the median income is generally smaller than the average income, for the majority 
of the population Income < Reg:GDP. This is consistent with the observations in our 
sample, where we Income < Reg:GDP for about 61% of the observations. We therefore 
expect this term being negative with respect to life satisfaction. table 12 con this 
prediction. We note that life satisfaction is negatively correlated with the di 
between regional and personal income, when this di is negative. At the same 
time the positive di does not signitly a life satisfaction. 
The role of personality traits 
The asymmetry between positive and negative di suggests an interpretation of the 
target in terms of prospect theory, where losses have, in absolute terms, a larger impact 
16Using the simple functional form: 
u(y) = ln(yi) and v(yi1  yi) = yi  yi. The life satisfaction will be hump shaped with a peak in y =

Considering the Logarithm of the di does not qualitatively e the result of the estimation.

than gains. In this respect the data in the WVS allows to perform a further test using 
modern studies on personality theory (see DeYoung C. G., Gray J. R. (2010) for a recent 
survey). In particular Neuroticism has been recently associated to higher sensitivity to 
negative emotions like anger, hostility or depression (Clark, L.A., and Watson, D. (2008)) 
and with structural features of the brain system associated with sensitivity to threat and 
punishment (DeYoung, C. G., Peterson, J. B., Sguin, J. R., Pihl, R. O., and Tremblay, 
E. (2008)). Neuroticism also signals low levels of serotonin in turns associated with 
aggression, poor impulse control, depression, and anxiety (Spoont, M. R. (1992); Depue, 
R. A. and Collins, P. F. (1999)). For this reason modern studies identify neuroticism 
with sensitivity to negative outcomes, and more broadly, in terms of prospect theory, loss 
aversion. Therefore, it is arguable that the elasticity between individual life satisfaction 
and (Reg:GDP 
 Income)+ could be modulated by Neuroticism. 
Measures of personality traits are not available in the WVS, but using the standard 
procedure of performing factor analysis on all the 20 personality questions { available in 
the wave 1989-93 of the WVS dataset{, we determine the personality traits neuroticism 
and extraversion. Details on the way Neuroticism and Extraversion have been generated 
and the list of the personality questions are presented in the appendix B. The summary 
statistics of Neuroticism and Extraversion variables are presented in table 11. 
Table 13 con our prediction that elasticity between individual life satisfaction 
and (Reg:GDP 
 Income)+ is modulated by Neuroticism. Neuroticism(Reg:GDP 
 
Income)+ is negative and signit suggesting a stronger negative e of the di 
Reg.GDP-Income, for more neurotic individuals. Note that our derived personality traits 
a life satisfaction in a way consistent with dings of the literature using measures of 
personality derived by surveys: It is a well known  that extraversion is positively 
correlated with life satisfaction and the opposite is true for neuroticism.

6 Conclusions 
We have reexamined the relation between life satisfaction and GDP using a methodology 
that avoids to impose particular functional forms on the model and found robust evidence 
of the existence of a bliss point in the interval of GDP between 26,000$ and 30,000$ (2005 
in PPP). This  lends support to the argument the way to reconcile the cross- 
sectional evidence { showing a positive relation between GDP and life satisfaction, and 
the times-series evidence { generally  no relationship { is that that the positive 
e of GDP disappears after a certain bliss point (Layard, 2005; Inglehart, 1990; 
Inglehart et al., 2008; di Tella et al., 2010). 
Furthermore, our analysis shows  evidence of a non monotonic relation between 
GDP and Life Satisfaction, with life satisfaction slightly decreasing after the bliss point. 
In light of our additional result the non monotonicity of the relation seems natural: with 
a simple example, we have shown that if the relation between life satisfaction and GDP is 
the result of combined e of personal income, increasing aspiration and/or increasing 
target in terms of income comparison, the net e may be non-monotonic. Our tests 
give support to the idea of a positive e due to the personal income and a negative 
e due to the negative distance between personal income and regional GDP. 
Accordingly, we have shown that this second e can be related to the negative e 
induced by the distance from an aspiration income. Furthermore, using recent  
of the modern personality theory, we argued that neuroticism might be linked to loss 
aversion in a prospect theory model. The way the relation between personal income 
and life satisfaction is a by neuroticism is also consistent with this interpretation. 
Individual welfare is a by the gap between realized and desired income. When the 
gap is negative, for lower level of income, extra income decreases in absolute terms this 
negative gap; therefore individuals with higher neuroticism score, that are more sensitive 
to reduce negative outcomes, become more satis

B Personality Traits 
B.1 Factor Analysis to Determine the Personality Traits 
Determination of traits from the score in each question was necessary because no existing 
imputation to traits on the sample of questions in the data exists. 
Trait determination was realized with exploratory factor analysis (statistical software 
Stata, release 11). We retained factors with eigenvalue larger than a threshold value of 1 
as suggested by dit sources. We selected all the personality questions in the WVS 
dataset, such questions were available only for the wave 1989-93. For completeness, we 
included also the variable e065 answering to the residual question ’none of the above’. 
In  4 we present the list of the questions and some descriptive statistics. In  
5 we present the Stata log showing the eigenvalues of all factors and the factor loadings. 
We plot the factors’ loadings with eigenvalues larger than 1 in  6, where we note 
that variables are clustered in two main groups. An high score in the group of variable 
with high loading on factor 1 represents high excitement and assertiveness, high seeking of 
stimulation and other people company, pronounced engagement with the external world. 
We therefore de factor 1 as Extraversion. An high score in the group of variables 
with high loading on factor 2 represents negative emotions like depression, loneliness, 
boredom, anxiousness, anger. We de factor 2 as Neuroticism. 
To complete the analysis we also present the rotated matrix in  7 and the 
Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy in ure 8. This test generate values 
between 0 and 1 for each single variable included, with small values meaning overall the 
variables have too little in common to warrant a factor analysis. All our variables show 
adequacy levels well above 0.7, generally considered the acceptable threshold.
