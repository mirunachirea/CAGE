Reciprocity towards Groups  
David Hugh-Jones and Martin A. Leroch* 
30 August 2011 
People exhibit group reciprocity when they retaliate, not against a person who harmed them, but against another person in that person's group. We tested for group   reciprocity   in   laboratory   experiments.   Subjects   played   a   Prisoner's Dilemma with partners from different groups. They then allocated money between themselves and other participants.  In punishment games, subjects whose partner had defected punished participants from the partner's group more, compared to their punishment of participants from a third group. In dictator-style games, subjects did not exhibit group reciprocity. We examine possible correlates of group reciprocity, including group identification and cooperativeness. 
Keywords: reciprocity, groups, conflict, experiment

Introduction 
In   the   summer   of   1906,   Atlanta,   a   city   previously   known   for   relatively 
peaceful race relations, saw a spate of newspaper coverage of black attacks on 
whites, in particular white women. (“Bold Negro Kisses White Girl's Hand,” 
screamed one headline.) On September 22nd, four assaults upon white women 
were reported. Armed with guns, a group of whites went downtown to a black 
neighbourhood  and attacked  black  men, killing  25.1   None  of the original 
alleged assaults  were later substantiated. 
Laboratory experiments have persuaded many economists that humans are 
reciprocators, who will pay so as to punish actions they perceive as unfair 
towards them or others   (Rabin 1993; Fehr and Gaechter 2000; Bolton and 
Ockenfels 2000).  Examples like the above suggest that people sometimes 
strike back, not against the individual who caused the perceived harm, but 
against other people in that individual's group. In these cases, those punished 
may have nothing to do with the initial offence,  and the offender himself may 
be completely unaffected by the retaliation. We call this kind of retaliation 
group reciprocity.

Group   reciprocity  appears   widespread  in  human   conflict,   including   riots, 
pogroms and ethnic civil wars. Many such  episodes involve calls for revenge 
against an opposing group for previous harms,  whether   real or imaginary, 
recent or ancient.2 Indeed, grievances over previous conflicts may provide the 
cause or pretext for  further outbreaks, leading to cycles of violence.3   These 
cycles  hinder   development   in   many   of   the   world's   poorest   states   (World 
Development Report 2011). 
Group   reciprocity   can   also   be   seen   in   ordinary   economic   behaviour. 
Consumers   may   boycott   the   produce   of   countries   whose   policies   they 
disapprove of, or products offered by specific ethnic groups. In 2010, during 
the European financial crisis, a German news magazine headline described 
Greeks as “Crooks in the European Family”. This led to a boycott of German 
products in Greece. Later, when Greek protesters used Nazi symbols to protest 
bailout conditions, the tabloid Das Bild  commented  “We pay  –  and still get 
insulted!”   Such   cycles   of   recrimination   may   affect   voters'   support   for 
Eurozone bailouts (Daily Telegraph 2010; Reuters 2011).  Companies, too, 
may  be targets for group reciprocity. In 1995, after  the Shell Corporation's

decision to sink the oil drilling platform “Brent Spar” in the North  Sea , several 
Shell  petrol  stations  in Germany  received bomb threats,  and  at least  one 
actually received  a letter bomb ( Die Welt 1995). Lastly, group reciprocity may 
be positive as well as negative: football fan  c ommunities sometimes maintain 
bonds of friendship, established by  acts of generosity such as refraining from 
physical assault on specific occasions (Koester 2008).   
Although group reciprocal  behaviour   has been attested beyond reasonable 
doubt,   we   know   little   about   the  motivations behind   it.   Acts   of   group 
reciprocity could be undertaken by materially self-interested, rational actors. 
For example, boycotting a country's exports may be seen as an effective way 
to change its policies. Striking back against groups may  help  someone to build 
a reputation for toughness. Or, not doing so might expose one to punishment 
from others in one's own group: one eyewitness of the Rwandan genocide 
stated “ten percent helped; 30 percent were forced to kill; 20 percent killed 
reluctantly; 40 percent killed enthusiastically”  (Mamdani 2001). However, as 
this quote suggests, it is also possible that some people may group-reciprocate 
even when there is no strategic incentive to do so. These people will act as if 
group fairness is a primitive in their utility function: they simply prefer to 
harm (or help) members of groups who have harmed (helped) them.4 
4 
We do not propose a particular functional form for group-reciprocal utility in this paper. 
Moreno (2008) models group fairness on the lines of Rabin (1993). 
4 

========5========

To investigate whether this is the case, we ran laboratory experiments in 
which there  was  no strategic incentive to group-reciprocate.   Subjects in the 
experiments were   divided   into   groups.   Each   group  jointly  completed   a 
cooperative task. Then, each subject played  a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) against 
a partner who was a member of a different group. After play in the  PD  was 
revealed, subjects  ma de  decisions allocating money between themselves and 
members of other groups. We compare each subject's allocations to the fellow 
group members of their partner in the PD, with their allocations to members of 
a different group with which   they ha d   not previously interacted. Using this 
other   group   as   a   control,   we   can   test   whether   subjects'   PD   partners' 
cooperation or defection affected  their allocations specifically to the partner's 
group. 
Our main findings are as follows. While the majority of our subjects do not 
group-reciprocate, and indeed do not discriminate at all between groups, a 
minority of subjects do group-reciprocate. In particular, we find significant 
evidence of group reciprocity in punishment decisions, where subjects must 
pay to harm others. However, we do not observe group reciprocity in dictator 
games where harming others benefits the subject.  Lastly, we examine some 
possible correlates of group reciprocity. Although group reciprocity is only 
induced when subjects cooperated and their partner defected, subjects who are 
more cooperative  in general   are no more likely to group-reciprocate than 
5

others. Group reciprocity is also not predicted by a psychological measure of 
group identification. 
In   the   next   section   we   review   the   relevant   literature,   and   explain   our 
contribution. We then describe our experiments and results. 
Related Literature 
Economists have long been interested in the economic consequences of groups 
and   ethnicity   (Becker   1957;   Arrow   1972;   Akerlof   1976).   More   recently, 
economic experimentalists have focused on how group membership affects 
behaviour, a topic that has long fascinated social psychologists (Sumner 1906; 
Sherif et al. 1961; Tajfel et al. 1971).   Hargreaves Heap and Zizzo (2009) 
show   experimentally   that   people   will   put   a   monetary   value   on   group 
membership. Further, people discriminate between in- and outgroups.  They 
cooperate   more   with   in-group   members   (de   Cremer   and   van   Vugt   1999; 
Goette and Huffman 2006, Guala et al. 2009; but cf. Bouckaert and Dhaene 
2004); give in-group members more, reward them more for good behaviour, 
and punish them less (Chen and Li 2009); they also punish offenders more 
when   the   victim   is   an   in-group   member   (Goette   and   Huffman   op.   cit., 
Bernhard et al. 2006). Debate continues over whether this different behaviour 
is driven by expectations of future reciprocity (Yamagishi and Kiyonari 2000; 
Yamagishi and Mifune 2008, 2009) or by pure preferences (Guala et al. 2009).

========7========

As psychologists have noted (Brewer 1999), ingroup bias  per se   does not 
imply that people will behave unkindly towards members of an outgroup, only 
that they will behave  more kindly towards members of their ingroup. For 
example, when asked to allocate a “bad” (exposure to aversive noise) among 
ingroup and outgroup members, members of a minimal groups did not favour 
the ingroup (Mummendey et al. 1992). Therefore, ingroup bias alone may not 
explain   the   empirical   regularity   that   many   real-world   conflicts   involve 
appalling   intergroup   violence   (Brewer   op.   cit.).     Dispositions   to   group 
reciprocity may be a missing part of the story. Individual biases towards one's 
own group, which are (relatively) innocuous in ordinary circumstances, can 
become more dangerous after a perceived threat or insult from another group. 
Psychologists   have   investigated   indirect   group   reciprocity   (i.e.   reciprocity 
towards groups in retaliation for harms done to other members of one's own 
group) under the term “vicarious retribution” (Lickel et al. 2006). Stenstrom et 
al. (2008) show that subjects will verbally express a demand for sanctions in 
retaliation for a presumed intergroup insult. In Gaertner et al. (2008), subjects 
allocated unpleasant noise to a group one of whose members had rejected the 
subject. 
Group reciprocity may also help to explain the harmful intergroup behaviour 
observed in some lab experiments.   Abbink and Herrmann (2009) created a 
ten-round vendetta game  between  two groups: in each round, subjects could 
7 

========8========

deduct money from the other group, at a cost to themselves. The low observed 
rates of this inefficient  behaviour (13%) were tripled (40%) by the addition of 
a symbolic reward.  Suggestively, rates of harmful actions were increased by 
the other group's harmful actions in the previous round,   although since the 
group included  the  person who chose the previous harmful action, group 
reciprocity cannot be clearly distinguished here from individual reciprocity. 
By contrast, Halevy et al. (2008) observe very low rates of intergroup harm 
when an option to benefit one's own group without harming the other group 
was available; this was a one-shot game, with less scope for  group reciprocity 
to operate. 
Similarly, some results from field data are compatible with group reciprocity. 
Shayo and Zussman (2010) show that Israeli judges were more likely to find 
in favour of Israeli plaintiffs against Arab defendants shortly after terrorist 
incidents. This could be explained by increased solidarity with the ingroup, or 
by bias against an outgroup perceived as responsible for an attack; a point 
favouring the former interpretation is that Arab judges were also more likely 
to find in favour of Arabs against Israelis after an attack. In a military context, 
Kocher   et   al.   (2008)   show   that   indiscriminate   US   bombing   in   Vietnam 
increased Vietcong control, suggesting that it drove Vietnamese civilians “into 
the arms of the rebels”.

========9========

We see our contribution as follows. We test experimentally, using real money 
payoffs,   whether people will reciprocate the actions of one group member 
when they make choices affecting other members of that group. Our design 
rules out strategic motivations, including expectations about others' behaviour 
towards oneself and reputational considerations. We clearly distinguish group 
from individual reciprocity, by ensuring that subjects knew they were not 
harming (helping) the person who had harmed (helped) them, but rather others 
from that person's group. By having subjects make allocations to multiple out- 
groups,   we   also   differentiate   reciprocity   towards   a   specific   group   from 
generalized reciprocity towards third parties (Dufwenberg et al. 2001, Nowak 
and Roch 2007). Thus, the   laboratory setting allows us to identify group 
reciprocal behaviour more cleanly than would be possible with field data. 
Experiments have been run both with lab-created groups (Tajfel et al. 1971; 
Hargreaves Heap and Zizzo 2009; Guala et al. 2009; Chen and Li 2009; 
Yamagishi and Kiyonari 2000; Yamagishi and Mifune 2008, 2009; de Cremer 
and van Vugt 1999) and with naturally occurring groups (Sherif et al. 1961; 
Fershtman   and   Gneezy   2001;   Bouckaert   and   Dhaene   2004;   Goette   and 
Huffman 2006; Bernhard et al. 2006; Habyarimana et al. 2009). We chose to 
use lab-created groups in our experiment, for two reasons. First, lab-created 
groups reduce the likelihood that subjects will bring into the lab set patterns of 
intergroup   behaviour,   which   might   have   a   strategic   or   group-reputational 
9 

========10========

component. Second, lab groups are relatively easy to create without access to a 
specific subject pool, and this contributes to our goal of developing a  simpl y 
reusable experimental paradigm.  We also note that the use of lab-created 
groups arguably provides a stronger test of group reciprocal motivations than 
using powerful existing identities such as ethnicity. Nevertheless, we believe 
that future tests of group reciprocity with naturally occurring groups will also 
be interesting and important. 
Experimental  Design 
We ran two experiments. Both experiments shared the following sequence of 
events. First, subjects were separated into colour-coded groups. Second, to 
increase   group   identification,   subjects   performed   a   collective   task.   Third, 
subjects were paired with members of other groups, and played a Prisoner's 
Dilemma (PD). Following Fehr and Fischbacher (2004), we think defection in 
a PD would be considered a norm violation by many of our subjects.5  Fourth, 
after   the   PD,   subjects   completed   allocation   tasks   involving   themselves, 
members of their PD partner's group (but not the PD partners themselves), and 
members of a third group with whom they had not previously interacted. 
Defection by a subject's PD partner might affect the subject's behaviour to 
5 
Note, however, that we chose a simultaneous PD game, whereas Fehr and Fischbacher 
(2004) analysed a sequential PD.

========11========

members of all other groups, not just to members of the partner's group; we 
use the allocations to the third group to control for this.  
Our basic empirical model is 
(1) 
givingi,g  = f( αi  + κ Self Di  + λ  Partner D 
i 
 +  μ  (Partner D 
i 
 × Self D 
i) 
+  Xiβ +  γ  Pgrpg   +   δ (Pgrpg ×   Self D 
i) +  ζ 
  ( Pgrpg ×   Partner D 
i) 
+  η 
(Pgrpg ×  Partner D 
i 
×  Self D 
i) + Pgrpg 
× Ziθ  +  εi,g) 
Here, givingi,g is the amount given by individual i  to a member of group  g ∈ 
{Partner,Other}. Pgrpg  is 1 if  g  is the  group of the subject's PD partner, and 0 
otherwise. Self Di  is 1 if subject  i defected in the PD and 0 otherwise. Partner 
Di   is 1 if the subject's PD partner defected and 0 otherwise.   We interact 
Partner   Di   with   Self   Di   because   it   is   plausible   that   subjects   will   react 
differently if they cooperated, but their partner defected, than if both they and 
their   partner   defected.  Parameters  κ,   λ  and  μ capture   the   effect  of   these 
covariates upon total amounts given. Our parameters of interest, however, are 
ζ  and  η. These are the effect of the PD partner's defection specifically on 
giving to the Partner group, above any effect on giving to the Other group. ζ 
gives the effect for subjects who are themselves PD cooperators and (ζ+η) 
gives the total effect for subjects who are defectors. Lastly,  αi   is a subject 
specific   intercept,  Xi   is   a   vector   of   known   covariates   which   may   affect 
subjects' giving to all groups, and  Zi   is a vector of known covariates which 
may influence subjects' giving to the Partner group alone. Subjects' individual 
11 

========12========

propensities to give, αi, are highly likely to be correlated with their behaviour 
in the PD, and therefore with values of Self D and  Self D ×  Partner D.  For this 
reason, we treat αi  as a fixed effect. If our specification were linear ( f(x)=x), 
then we could use first-differencing to eliminate both the fixed effects and all 
the terms affecting amounts given in general, leaving: 
(2) 
   giving 
i,partner 
  – giving 
i,other  =  γ 
  +   δ   Self D 
i 
  +   ζ   Partner D 
i 
  +   η 
(Partner Di ×  Self D 
i) 
+ Ziθ + εi,partner  –  εi,other 
Our data is not suitable for a linear model in either experiment, so that naïve 
first-differencing will not work, but we use estimation strategies based upon 
the same idea. 
For clarity and ease of comparison, the sequence of treatments and choices in 
both experiments is illustrated in Table 1  below. The complete description of 
the experiments follows.

One session had 5 groups; 5 groups in total, over 4 sessions, had only 2 members.

Experiment 1 
Experiment 1 was run at the Jena laboratory of the Max Planck Institute for 
Economics,   using   the   computer   software   zTree   (Fischbacher   2007).7   180 
subjects, recruited via ORSEE (Greiner 2004), took part during 6 sessions. 
Each   session   lasted   about   1   hour.   Subjects   were   paid   in   Experimental 
Currency Units (ECU), with 1 ECU = 1 Euro. 
In each session, 30 subjects were randomly allocated into three groups named 
red, green  and  blue. Each subject was given a player number, running from 1- 
10 within each group. These numbers, together with the group names, were 
used   to   identify   subjects   to   each   other   throughout   the   remainder   of   the 
experiment. In order to increase group identification and entitativity (the sense 
that each group forms a single entity), each group played a team game. This 
was an adapted version of the card game Pelmanism, in which players have to 
find pairs of identical cards from a face-down deck. In our computer version, 
the whole group anonymously voted for which card to turnover, and one 
selected member then observed the votes and chose a card. The group which 
found   the   most   pairs   was   awarded   5   ECU.   The   winning   group   was   not 
revealed until the end of the experiment.

========15========

After   the   Pelmanism   game,   subjects   were   allocated   into   pairs,   each   pair 
containing subjects from two different groups. They were informed of their 
partner's   group   and   player   number.   They   then   played   a   one-shot   PD. 
Afterwards,  subjects   were shown their   partner's choices  and  the  resulting 
payoffs for both players. We call each subject's PD partner's group the Partner 
group; the remaining group is the Other group. For instance, if a red group 
member played the PD against a green group member, then for her the green 
group is the Partner group, and the blue group is the Other group.

TABLE 2: ALLOCATIONS IN  E XPERIMENT  1 
Lastly,   each   subject   made   a   set   of   ten   binary   choices,   allocating   money 
between him- or herself and one or more other subjects (the “target(s)”), 
always identified by their player number and group. The choices are shown in 
Table 2. Subjects chose between allocation A and allocation B. There are five 
pairs of similar choices; we refer to each pair as a “choice set”. In each choice 
set, subjects faced tradeoffs between maximizing their own income, helping 
15 

========16========

the target, and increasing or decreasing inequality.   Choice sets 1-4 allocate 
money to the subject him- or herself and to one other target. Choice B always 
gives less to the target. Choice sets 1 and 2 involve “punishment choices”: the 
subject can either maximize  his own and the other's income, or pay to reduce 
the other's income. They also have distributional consequences: the income- 
maximizing choice in set 1 is unequal in the other's favour, compared to the 
alternative. In set 2, the income-maximizing choice is less unequal than the 
alternative. Choice sets 3 and 4 are “dictator” choices: the subject can either 
maximize his own income, or reduce his income but give more to the other. In 
set 3 the selfish allocation also reduces other-favouring inequality; in set 4 it 
increases self-favouring inequality.  Each of choice sets 1-4 is made once 
where the target is a member of the Partner group (1P-4P) and once when the 
target is a member of the Other group (1O-4O). Two allocations, 5P and 5O, 
were between a Partner group member and an Other group member, with the 
subject herself not being involved. The choice here was which of the two 
groups to favour; A is the efficient choice. By comparing subjects' decisions 
within each pair of choices in a choice set, we can observe the effect of the 
target's group membership.  
Subjects never made allocations involving their previous PD partner – only 
involving other members of the same group. They could easily observe this, 
because the PD partner's group and player number, along with the outcome of 
16 

========17========

the   PD,   was   shown   onscreen   (in   a   “history   box”)   throughout   the   10 
allocations. The order of the allocations was randomized. At the end of the 
experiment a single allocation was randomly selected, and the relevant payoffs 
were implemented. 
After   the   experiment,   subjects   were   given   a   questionnaire   including 
demographics,   measures   of   group   identity,   and   debriefing   questions.   The 
winning group of the Pelmanism game was then revealed. Finally, subjects 
were called up and paid privately for their winnings from the Pelmanism 
game, the Prisoner's Dilemma, and the randomly selected allocations (their 
own and others'). Each subject also received a 2.50 Euro showup fee. 
Two points about this design deserve attention. First, allocation into groups 
and of PD partners within groups was random, and prior to the PD, subjects 
had no interaction with groups other than their own. Hence, in what follows, 
we can treat subjects' PD partners' cooperation or defection as an exogenous 
variable. Second, subjects knew that the allocations were the last part of the 
experiment. Therefore, in making allocation decisions, they had no strategic 
reasons to play a particular way (e.g. reputation-building). These comments 
also apply to Experiment 2. Descriptive statistics for our subjects are shown in 
Table 3.

Figure 1  shows the percentage of B choices made in each of the 10 allocations, 
split by whether the PD partner cooperated or defected. In choice sets 1-4, B is 
the decision that gives least to the target. In general,   PD partner defection 
increases   the   proportion   of   B   choices.   In   choice   set   1,   partner   defection 
decreases unkind choices (which also reduce the subject's own payoff), but 
more so towards the Other group than towards the Partner group. Patterns for 
the other choice sets are less clear.

Table 4  tabulates the pairs of choices made by our subjects in each choice set, 
split   up   by   whether   the   PD   partner   cooperated   or   defected.  In   order   to 
investigate whether PD partner's defection affected discriminatory behaviour, 
we examine only those subjects who discriminated either for or against the 
Partner   group.   If   PD   partner   behaviour   does   not   affect   the   level   of 
discrimination,   i.e.   if  ζ=η=0   in   equation   (1),   then   there   should   be   no 
association between partner behaviour and the proportion, among those who 
discriminate in either direction, of those who discriminate against the Partner 
group. The final row of Table 4  shows the results of the corresponding Fisher

test.8  Only the first choice set shows a significant effect: PD  partner  defection 
was associated with more discrimination against the Other group. Apparently, 
subjects who had been defected against were more willing to harm the target 
when the target was from the Partner group.

we run logit regressions. Thus, in equation (1), we take  
f(x)=GA  if x>0; G

in each of the five choice sets, where  GJ  is the amount given to the target by

effects logits  failed to converge in 2 out of 5 regressions, probably because 
this approach ignores subjects who made the same choice against both Partner 
and Other group members, leaving   insufficient cases for estimation. As a 
second   best,   we   estimate   random   effects   logits.  Table   5   reports   selected 
coefficients. For each choice set, the first column comes from a regression 
without controls (i.e.  with  X  and  Z  empty). Controls are not necessary, since 
the   main   variable  Partner   D   is   guaranteed   to   be   exogenous   by   the 
experimental design, but appropriate controls will increase the accuracy of our 
estimates in the nonlinear logit model. The second column adds a vector of 
controls   to   both  X  and  Z: dummies   for   gender,   for   subjects   studying 
economics, and for group colour. The third column adds the controls and also 
a vector of session dummies.9   The coefficients of interest are quite stable 
across these specifications. Partner D  significantly predicts less generosity to 
the partner group in choice set 1 only, although this variable approaches weak 
significance in choice set 4. The Partner D × Self D  interaction is significant 
in choice set 5, but this is not easy to interpret, since the coefficient on Partner 
D  is small and insignificant. Thus, group reciprocity was only evident in one 
out of the five choice sets.  
9 
Regressions for choice set 2 failed to converge and are omitted. It is clear from Table 4 
that partner defection would not be significant in choice set 2, under any specification.

Experiment  2 
Experiment   1   produced   evidence   for   group   reciprocity   in   1   out   of   2 
punishment choices, with little evidence for group reciprocity in the dictator 
choices (sets 3 and 4). To confirm these results, we ran a second experiment. 
In this design, subjects made continuous rather than binary choices at the final 
stage.   By allowing subjects finer-grained control over their allocations, we 
hoped to get more accurate estimates of the distribution of group reciprocal 
preferences   in   the   population.   We   also   changed   our   group   identity 
manipulation to increase levels of group identification. The new manipulation 
was a quiz on collective animal names, allowing for computer-based chat 
among participants of the same group.10 
Experiment 2 was run at the University of Warwick experimental laboratory, 
again using zTree. 172 subjects, recruited from the subject pool via ORSEE, 
participated in 10 sessions. Subjects were paid in ECU, this time with 100 
ECU = £1. At the start of the experiment, subjects were informed that the 
experiment   had   4   stages,   and   that   instructions   for   each   stage   would   be 
revealed prior to the stage itself. In stage 1, subjects were randomly paired to 
play an initial PD, the results of which were not revealed until the end of the 
10 
Pretests showed that this manipulation was successful in increasing subjects' levels of 
group identification. 
23 

========24========

experiment. The aim of this pre-group PD was to observe subjects' propensity 
to cooperate, before any group assignment took place. 
In stage 2, subjects were separated into 6 groups,  red,  green,  blue,  purple, 
orange   and   cyan.11   For the remainder of the experiment, all subjects were 
identified to others by their group name, combined with an individual, within- 
group number. (In this experiment, subjects were not informed of their own 
number.) After being assigned to their group, subjects took a collective quiz 
on   animal   group   names.   Subjects   could   communicate   with   other   group 
members via computer chat.12    The members of the group with the highest 
average   number   of   correct   answers   won   1000   ECU   each.   Other   groups 
received 100 ECU each. Announcement of the winning group took place after 
a final questionnaire was answered. 
After the quiz, in stage 3, subjects were paired with subjects from other 
groups, identified by group name and player number, and played a one-shot 
11 
Most sessions consisted of 18 subjects in 6 groups of 3. However, due to no-shows, some 
sessions   had   fewer   subjects   and   one   session   had   only   5   groups.   Subjects   were   not 
explicitly informed of the groups' sizes. 
12 
We required subjects not to reveal personal information during the chat. All subjects 
obeyed   this  instruction.   Chat   messages   were   almost   exclusively   focused   on   the  quiz 
answers. 
24 

========25========

PD, just as in Experiment 1. Afterwards, as before, subjects were shown their 
partner's choices and the resulting payoffs.  
Finally, in stage 4, subjects made 6 allocation decisions allocating money 
between themselves and another participant (the “target”). 3 of these decisions 
were dictator games, with a “taking” frame: the target was endowed with 1000 
ECU, and subjects could take up to 1000 ECU from the target for themselves. 
This dictator game was played once against a member of the PD partner's 
group (but not the PD partner himself: subjects knew this because a history of 
play, including player numbers, was visible on screen), once against a member 
of a third group subjects had not previously any interacted with, and once 
against a member of the subject's own group. Again, we refer to these groups 
as the Partner, Other and Own groups. We do not analyse choices against the 
Own group further in this paper.13   The remaining 3 decisions were costly 
punishment games in which subjects chose the number of ECU to deduct from 
the other subject's payoff. Subjects chose x between 0 and 300;  they received 
400-x   and   the   target   received   900-3 x.   Again   this  game   was   played   once 
against   members   of   the   Partner,   Other,   and   Own   groups.   The   order   of 
allocation tasks was randomized.   
After the experiment, subjects answered a questionnaire. Then the winning 
group of the quiz, the result of the stage 1 PD, and the stage(s) chosen for

We intend to examine these decisions in separate work on in-group favoritism.

payment were revealed. Finally,  subjects were called up and paid privately, 
receiving in addition a GBP 5  showup fee. For 5 of the 10 sessions one of the 
four different stages was selected for payment; in the other 5 sessions, either 
stages 1 and 2, or stages 3 and 4 were paid. Under the first payment method 
(selection of one stage only), if the stage 3 PD is paid, then the subject's stage 
4 allocations are not paid. This allows us to examine whether others' intentions 
alone suffice to induce group reciprocity, or whether those intentions must 
also   have   material   results.   We   found   few   consistent   differences   between 
behaviour under the two payment methods, so we pool them in the subsequent 
analysis.14  Table  6  shows descriptive statistics for Experiment 2.

Figure 2  shows empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions of the amounts 
given to the other subject, in the “dictator” or “taking” choice, and in the 
“punishment” choice, split up by PD partner behaviour. The first row shows 
amounts given by all subjects. The second row shows amounts given by 
subjects who themselves cooperated in the PD. Three facts stand out. First, 
most subjects gave either 500 or nothing in the taking choice, quite typically 
for dictator games (Engel 2010; see Bardsley 2008 for a dictator game with a 
taking   frame),   and   most   subjects   did   not   punish   (i.e.   gave   900)   in   the 
punishment   choice.   Second,   subjects   became   more   selfish   in   the   dictator 
choices   if   their   PD   partners   defected.   Third,   in   punishment   choices, 
cooperators appear to have punished the Partner group more, but the Other 
group less, if their PD partners defected. 
The data is highly non-normal. In the punishment decisions, more than half of 
our subjects chose to give the maximum amount of 900 ECU. We therefore 
analyse the data using a Tobit model: f(x) = min{x, 900} in equation (1). We 
use the semi-parametric estimator defined by Honore (1992), which removes 
the subject-specific fixed effects by a process analogous to first-differencing, 
and which does not rely on assumptions about the functional form of the errors 
εi,g. The dictator decisions are more complex: many subjects gave 0 ECU, and 
many gave 500 ECU, with some donations between 0 and 500 and a few 
27 

========28========

above 500. We analysed these using a fixed effects Tobit with f(x)=max{x,0} 
in (1)15.  
15 
We also tried a fixed effects ordered logit estimator using the approach of Baetschmann et 
al. (2011), categorizing the amount given as 0, 1-499, 500, or above 500. The results are 
qualitatively similar to those reported here, and are available on request.

TABLE 7: FE TOBIT REGRESSIONS, EXPERIMENT  2 
Table 7  shows the results. Columns 1-3 are regressions on the amount given in 
the punishment decisions. The first column is a simple regression on Self D, 
Partner D  and their interaction, without controls. The second column adds a 
vector of controls to Z in equation (1). As before, appropriate controls should 
increase  the   efficiency   of  our  estimates.   (The   Honore  estimator   does  not 
estimate the fixed effects, nor effects for variables that are constant across a 
30 

========31========

group, so we cannot include controls in X  in (1).) Controls include dummies 
for gender, for subjects who studied economics, and for subjects' colour  group; 
in addition we include a measure of the proportion of male subjects in the 
whole session, since this varied quite widely and we considered that it might 
affect levels of group reciprocity, and a dummy for the order of the Partner 
group and Other group decisions. Column 3 adds session fixed effects. The 
coefficient on PD partner defection is consistently large and negative, and is 
more precisely estimated when controls are included. The coefficient on the 
interaction of partner defection and own defection is large and positive; the 
sum of these two coefficients (i.e. ζ+η  in equation (1))  is never significantly 
different from 0. Columns 4-6 are regressions on the amount given in dictator 
decisions. The coefficients on both  Partner D   and   Self D × Partner D   are 
small and not statistically significant. Thus, subjects who cooperated in the PD 
responded to PD partner defection by giving less to members of the Partner 
group, but only in punishment decisions, where harming the other participant 
was costly to the subject.  
These   results   conformed   to   the   basic   pattern   of   Experiment   1:   group 
reciprocity was observed in punishment decisions but not in dictator decisions. 
In addition, group reciprocity was observed only among those who themselves 
cooperated in the PD. This finding could be interpreted in two ways. Subjects 
may   react   strongly   to   betrayal   in   the   PD,   but   not   to   mutual   defection. 
31 

========32========

Alternatively, subjects who are in general more cooperative may react more to 
others' defection, whether or not they themselves cooperated in a particular 
instance (but these subjects are also more likely to cooperate in the PD). To 
distinguish between these two explanations, Experiment 2 included an initial, 
anonymous Prisoner's Dilemma without feedback, before subjects were placed 
into groups. We use subjects' behaviour in this first PD to categorize them as 
cooperative or non-cooperative “types”. Decisions in the first and second PD 
were correlated: about 50% of cooperators in the first PD defected in the 
second PD, while about 75% of defectors in the first PD defected again in the 
second (chi-squared test, p<0.01).

TABLE 8: FE TOBIT REGRESSIONS, INTERACTIONS WITH INITIAL  PD 
33 

========34========

Table 8  adds  Self D1, a dummy taking the value 1 if subjects defected in the 
initial anonymous PD, to the first 3 regressions of Table 7, and interacts it with 
Partner D  and  Self D. If the size of the Partner D × Self D  interaction in  Table 
7  is genuinely caused by betrayal in the main PD, then the  Self D1  coefficient 
should not be significant. On the other hand, if the interaction arises because 
people with cooperative personalities react more strongly to partner defection, 
then the interactions with Self D  should lose significance, and interactions with 
Self D1  should be significant instead. In fact,  Self D1  and its interactions are 
never significant, and, as the “summed coefficient” rows show, the effect of 
partner defection is consistently larger for subjects who  defected   in stage 1. 
Thus, behaviour in the initial PD does not help to explain why “betrayal” 
causes more group reciprocal behaviour than mutual defection. We conclude 
that only betrayal induces group reciprocity, and that it does so among both 
more and less cooperative subjects. 
Social identity theorists argue that intergroup discrimination is caused by the 
level of people's identification with their own group – the extent to which they 
perceive themselves as part of the group and take on its interests as their own 
(Tajfel   et   al.   1971;   Tajfel   1982).   We   were   interested   in   whether   group 
identification   could   help   explain   group-reciprocal   behaviour.   In   both 
experiments,   the   final   questionnaire   included   questions   measuring   group 
identification, adapted from Ellemers et al. (1999). We created a variable 
34 

========35========

Group ID  by summing answers to these questions. 
16 
Table 9  reproduces the 
first 3 columns of  Table 7, interacting the other independent variables with 
Group ID. We expected that subjects who showed higher identification with 
their group would be more likely to group-reciprocate. In fact, while Group 
ID  itself predicts less giving to the partner group, its interaction terms are not 
significant. Indeed, the effect of partner defection is stronger among those 
with lower Group ID. Thus, group identification does not seem to be a useful 
predictor of group reciprocal behaviour. 
16 
Results using an alternative Group ID variable, derived from the questionnaire scores by 
factor analysis, were very similar to those shown here.

TABLE 9: FE TOBIT REGRESSIONS, INTERACTIONS WITH GROUP IDENTITY, 
EXPERIMENT  2 
36 

========37========

Experiments involving lab-created groups can run the risk of demand effects, 
in   which   subjects   follow   norms   implicitly   suggested   by   the   experimental 
design. We took steps to minimize this risk. For example, we randomized the 
order of allocation decisions, so as to avoid obvious pairings of similar choices 
made vis-à-vis Partner and Other group members. We also asked subjects 
about   the   experiment's   purpose   in   the   final   questionnaire.   Many   subjects 
answered   that   the   experiment   was   about   teamwork;   only   a   few   (7   in 
Experiment   1;   3   in   Experiment   2)   mentioned  e.g.   “revenge”   or   related 
concepts. Rerunning our analyses without these subjects does not affect our 
results. 
Interpretation 
The   results   above,   coming   from   a   new   experimental   design,   need   to   be 
interpreted with care. Nevertheless, we here draw some initial conclusions. 
Firstly   and   most   importantly:   taken   together,   our   experiments   provide 
evidence for group reciprocity. Some subjects responded to their PD partner's 
defection by reducing their allocations specifically to other members of the 
partner's group, even at a cost to themselves. Group reciprocity was observed 
in   the   absence   of   strategic   incentives,   supporting   a   preferences-based 
explanation.  
37 

========38========

Second,   group   reciprocity   did   not   affect   all   decisions   equally.     We   saw 
significant   evidence   for   it   only   in   choices   where   the   Pareto-dominant 
allocation would give subjects less than the other participant, but subjects 
could pay to lower the discrepancy.  This is surprising, since we did not 
observe group reciprocation in the dictator games, where subjects could have 
punished   costlessly   (indeed   at   a   profit).   One   possibility   is   that   group 
punishment does not obey the law of demand (cf. Anderson and Putterman 
2006). 
Lastly,  not all subjects group-reciprocated. Indeed, the majority of subjects did 
not discriminate between groups. More cooperative subjects, as measured by 
an initial anonymous PD,  were not more likely to group-reciprocate than less 
cooperative ones, conditional on their choice to cooperate in the main PD. 
Also, group reciprocal behaviour was not predicted by psychological measures 
of   group   identification,   which   suggests   that   a   different   psychological 
mechanism is at work than that posited by Social Identity Theory. Other 
psychological   theories   not   tested   here,   such   as   social   dominance   theory 
(Sidanius and Pratto 1999), might have more explanatory power. 
Conclusion 
In recent years, evidence from laboratory and field experiments has challenged 
the motivational  assumption of material self-interest, introducing  concerns 
38 

========39========

such as fairness and reciprocity.  One so far under-emphasized  factor, we 
believe, is that humans, who often act in groups, often also treat other groups 
as actors. They may therefore assign blame and praise to groups as well as 
individuals – with important consequences for human society and politics. At 
times in history, entire groups have been blamed and scapegoated for their 
members' real or imagined behaviour. Laboratory experiments could help in 
understanding the processes behind this phenomenon. In our experiments, 
subjects   responded   to   one   group   member's   behaviour   by   treating   other 
members of that group differently. 
Discriminatory behaviour may be driven by beliefs rather than by preferences. 
For example, ethnic discrimination in hiring may come from   statistical or 
screening   discrimination   (Arrow   1972)   rather   than   from   a   “taste   for 
discrimination” (Becker 1957).  In our experiments, strategic incentives were 
ruled   out:   group   reciprocity   appear s   to   be   a  matter   of   pure   preference. 
However,  we caution   against  too  narrow an  interpretation  of  this.  Group 
reciprocity may be due to the activation of context-specific norms, rather than 
to “preferences” thought of as unchanging characteristics of  individuals. 
The majority of our subjects did not exhibit group reciprocity, and it was not 
visible in all decisions. To investigate the causes and correlates of group 
reciprocity,   our   experimental   paradigm   needs   further   refinement. 
Complementary experiments could be done using homegrown identities such 
39 

========40========

as ethnicity. Lastly, we have still to investigate third-party group reciprocity, 
in which people retaliate against a group for harm done not to themselves, but 
to a fellow group member of theirs. 
Demonstrating   group   reciprocity   in   a   reproducible   laboratory   experiment 
could open the door to deeper exploration of how it works. We draw an 
analogy with the minimal group paradigm in psychology. After Sherif's initial 
research   in   the   1950s   on   in-group   prejudice,   the   famous   Robber's   Cave 
experiment   (Sherif  1961),  researchers  developed   a canonical  experimental 
paradigm to analyse in-group prejudice (Tajfel et al. 1971). By making the 
behaviour of interest reproducible, the minimal group paradigm catalysed a 
productive tradition of research on prejudice. We hope that our experiment 
will similarly encourage further study of this phenomenon under controlled 
conditions. This could be a valuable complement to field study of the often 
extreme situations where group reciprocity produces its most visible effects.

Appendix: further statistical analyses 
For online publication 
The experiment questionnaire asked if subjects had met any of the other 
participants before. Some subjects (39) answered that they had. These subjects 
might have had strategic motivations for behaving in a certain way if they 
expected to meet these subjects again. We are not very concerned about this, 
because   all   decisions   were   anonymous   and   subjects'   roles   were   assigned 
randomly. Nevertheless,  Table 10   reruns the basic regressions of   Table 7, 
excluding all these subjects. Results are basically unchanged.

Sessions 6-10 of Experiment 2 used a different payment method, paying either 
both stages 1 and 2, or both stages 3 and 4 (the PD and the allocations). Table 
11  adds a dummy  Payboth  to columns 1, 2, 4 and 5 of   Table 7, and interacts it 
with Self D, Partner D  and their interaction.  Results are not very clear. The 
Payboth  dummy interacts significantly with  Partner D  in the regression on 
punishment choices in column 1,  but the coefficient is much smaller and 
insignificant when controls are added. There is also a significant interaction in

the controlled regression on dictator choices (column 4). However, neither the 
coefficient on Partner D itself, nor the summed coefficient Partner D + 
Payboth × Partner D, is significantly different from zero. Overall, we think it 
reasonable to pool the sessions for analysis, as in the main text.
