Abstract 
Substantial evidence suggests that countries or regions with stronger trade linkages tend to have business cycles that are more synchronized. The standard international business cycle framework cannot replicate this  In this paper, we study a multi-country model of international trade with vertical trade linkages, imperfect competition, and variable markups. We embed it in a real business cycle framework by including aggregate technology shocks and allowing for a variable labor supply. A carefully calibrated version of the theoretical economy that  the model to data on the bilateral trade volume between 210 distinct country-pairs explains between 20 and 41 percent of the relation between trade intensity and business cycle synchronization. We provide empirical evidence supporting the model’s predictions for the association between trade costs and business cycle synchronization, and exchange rate volatility and business cycle synchronization.

1 Introduction 
Substantial empirical evidence suggests that countries or regions with stronger trade linkages have 
more correlated business cycles. Frankel and Rose (1998), Clark and van Wincoop (2001), Calderon, 
Chong, and Stein (2007), Baxter and Kouparitsas (2004), and Imbs (2004), among others, show that 
pairs of countries that trade with each other exhibit a high degree of business cycle comovement. 
These  have been interpreted as evidence that trade integration leads to business cycle 
synchronization. 
From a theoretical perspective, however, international business cycle models have had diy 
in replicating this empirical fact (see Kose and Yi, 2001, and Kose and Yi, 2006). In the latter 
paper, the authors’ baseline model explains one-tenth of the responsiveness of comovement to trade 
intensity. This has given rise to the so-called trade-comovement puzzle: Standard models are unable 
to generate high output correlations arising from high bilateral trade intensity. 
These models are either two-country or three-country representations of the world economy. 
However, it is likely that pairs of countries with higher bilateral trade intensity also share substantial 
trade linkages with common trading partners. A two-country or three-country model is unable to 
capture this feature of the data and leads to an attenuated link between trade and business cycle 
synchronization. Instead, by considering a multi-country world economy and calibrating the model’s 
trade costs to match each bilateral trade volume we capture both the bilateral trade linkages and 
the trade linkages with common trading partners. 
Therefore, we consider a model that consists of 21 countries, as is the case in our data sample. 
We calibrate the model’s trade costs to match each country-pair’s bilateral trade volume|that 
is, there are 210 country-pairs. We assess the model’s ability to generate high business cycle 
correlations between countries with strong trade linkages. The model is quite successful at solving 
the trade-comovement puzzle. Quantitatively, it explains up to 41 percent of the empirical relation 
between trade intensity and comovement. 
Our theoretical framework contains the following ingredients: vertical trade linkages, imperfect 
competition, and trade costs. In particular, we build on Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum 
(2003), and allow for endogenous markups to vary across producers of dit e who set 
prices a la Bertrand. Our proposed mechanism operates as follows: 
2 

========3========

(i) Higher trade costs decrease the level of vertical specialization and, hence, trade intensity. 
(ii) At lower levels of vertical specialization, there are fewer opportunities for countries to bene 
from foreign e shocks, reducing comovement. 
(iii) Trade costs lead to a failure of the relative purchasing power parity (PPP) relation and 
increased exchange rate volatility. 
In this way higher trade costs prevent arbitrage, which generates pricing-to-market, reduces 
trade, and hampers the transmission of shocks across countries, lowering business cycle synchroniza- 
tion.1 Instead, if trade costs are absent, there is full vertical specialization and price discrimination 
is not possible. In this case, the business cycles are perfectly synchronized and the PPP relation 
holds perfectly. Given that pricing-to-market is associated with higher exchange rate volatility, our 
model contains two additional predictions: (i) Exchange rate volatility is higher for countries with 
higher trade costs; and (ii) higher exchange rate volatility is associated with lower business cycle 
synchronization. We use a measure of bilateral transaction costs to provide empirical evidence 
supporting these predictions. 
In addressing the association between trade and comovement, the literature has suggested the 
importance of the key elements of our model. The role of vertical integration was highlighted 
in Burstein, Kurz, and Tesar (2008). The authors show that countries with tighter links in the 
chain of production exhibit higher bilateral manufacturing output correlations.2 
Arkolakis and 
Ramanarayanan (2009) develop an international business cycle model augmented with vertical 
specialization. Although vertical specialization provides a potential mechanism for the model to 
generate increased business cycle correlation with higher trade, this mechanism is not sutly 
strong. The authors note that an extension of their setup to a model with more than two countries, 
calibrated to match bilateral trade shares would be essential to address this question. Our paper 
shows that a multicountry model featuring imperfect competition that is carefully calibrated to 
match bilateral trade shares goes a long way towards resolving the trade-comovement puzzle. 
1The term pricing-to-market refers to the decision by a single producer to change the relative price at which she sells her output abroad and at home in response to changes in international relative costs. 
2In a recent paper, Di Giovanni and Levchenko (2009) emphasize the empirical relevance of vertical linkages in production to explain the e of bilateral trade on business cycle synchronization.

========4========

Our theoretical model considers a setting with balanced trade (i.e., nancial autarky). Heath- 
cote and Perri (2002) show that the nancial autarky economy is closest to the data along most 
dimensions compared with the complete markets economy and the bond-only economy. In particu- 
lar, the  autarky model better accounts for the observed cross-country output, consumption 
and employment correlations. Kose and Yi (2006)  that  autarky helps to resolve the 
trade-comovement puzzle. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the equilibrium 
model of trade and the business cycle that we use to analyze the relation between trade integration 
and business cycle synchronization. The model results are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we 
estimate the Frankel and Rose (FR, 1998) regressions using our data and sample period and assess 
the potential of our model to replicate the empirical relation between trade and comovement. We 
also investigate further the empirical link between trade costs, real exchange rate volatility, and 
business cycle synchronization. Finally, Section 5 concludes. 
2 The Theoretical Economy 
In this section we develop a simple model of the link between trade integration and business cycle 
synchronization. The setup of the model builds on Bernard et al. (2003). The global economy 
consists of K countries, each represented by a continuum of unit measure of identical and in 
lived households. In each period of time t, the global economy experiences one of  many 
states, or events, st. We denote by st = (s0; : : : ; st) the history of events through period t. The probability, as of period 0, of any particular history st is (st). The initial realization s0 is given. 
2.1 Technology and Market Structure 
Each country consumes a non-traded  good that is produced competitively by domestic  
good  The representative od  in country i makes use of a continuum of diti- 
ated manufactured intermediate commodities indexed by n 2 [0; 1] that are combined as follows

where Yi 
 
st is od output in country i, and Xi 
 
n; st is the input of the ditiated 
intermediate commodity of type n. The parameter  2 (0;1) relates to the elasticity of substitution 
across ditiated intermediate commodities, given by  = 1=(1 
 ). Hence, the demand in 
country i for intermediate variety n satis the relation

is the ideal price index in country i of the al good. 
Trade barriers: The ditiated intermediate commodities are subject to trade barriers taking 
the form of an iceberg cost: To successfully deliver in country j one unit of any ditiated 
intermediate commodity produced in country i, ji  1 units need to be shipped, with ii = 1. 
Intermediate-good sector: The structure of the intermediate-good sector is inspired by Bernard 
et al. (2003) and, in particular, we treat productivity di across producers adopting a 
probabilistic formulation. Each intermediate commodity n 2 [0; 1] has many potential producers 
in each country. However, these  di in productivity|indexed by ’. The kth most ent producer of commodity n in country i requires 1= 
’n  
ki 
st units of the input bundle to produce one unit of the intermediate good. The unit cost of the input bundle in country i is !i. Therefore, the 
cost for the kth most et producer in country i of delivering in country j a unit of intermediate 
commodity n is 
 
zkji 
 
 
n; st = 
!i

It follows that the most et potential supplier of commodity n to country j faces the cost

n; st: 
(4) 
We assume that the individual-goods producing  are engaged in imperfect competition. In 
particular, the price charged for each intermediate commodity is assumed to be determined from 
Bertrand competition. Hence, each country j is captured by the lowest-cost supplier to that market 
5 

========6========

but this supplier is constrained to not charge a price higher than the second-lowest cost of supplying 
the market. If the lowest-cost supplier to country j is a country i  the price set by this  
cannot exceed 
 
  Z2j n; st = min z2ji 
 
n; st;minz1i0=i 
 
ji0 
n; st : 
6 
(5) 
Therefore, if the lowest-cost supplier to country j is a country i  this rm is directly competing 
against the second-lowest-cost supplier from country i and the lowest-cost supplier from the other 
countries. 
However, equation (5) is not enough to characterize the equilibrium price charged by the  
capturing the market as it imposes only an upper bound to the price charged by the lowest-cost 
supplier. In equilibrium, the  capturing each market either sets a price equal to the upper 
bound or, if the upper bound is higher than the monopoly price, the  charges the monopoly price, given by Z1j 
 
n; st

j of each intermediate commodity n is given by

Suppose that the same  (a country i  is the lowest-cost supplier to both country j and country i. There is pricing-to-market when the change in the markup in export price, j

Hence, it follows from equations (4) and (5), that the presence of trade costs is a necessary condition for pricing-to-market to arise. In the absence of 
trade costs, the law of one price is satis for each intermediate commodity and the PPP condition 
holds perfectly. 
Complete characterization of the equilibrium prices requires the speci of how the e 
ciencies are distributed across  and countries. We follow Bernard et al. (2003) and model

 e using a probabilistic approach: It is assumed that the joint distribution of the 
lowest-cost supplier and of the second-lowest-cost supplier from country i is characterized by the 
following cumulative distribution function:

Using equations (3), (4) and (5), it follows that the implied joint distribution of the lowest-cost, 
, and second-lowest-cost, 
Z2j n; st, of supplying commodity n in country j is given by 
i = P rob Z1j st  Z1; Z2j st  Z2 st

XK 
j st = Ti st(!iji) 
 
 
i=1 
 
 
 
(9) 
and determines the distribution of prices and markups. The result is that aggregate  
in country j are determined by the behavior of this variable. In particular, in equilibrium the ideal 
price index in country j of the  good is given by 
Pj st = j st 
1= 
; 
 
where  is a positive constant.5

The numeraire good: We assume that production of each manufactured intermediate commodity 
combines labor and a homogeneous, nonmanufactured input, with labor having a constant share

. The nonmanufactured input is freely traded and is used as the numeraire. It is produced under 
constant returns to scale using only labor, with one unit of labor in country i producing Wi units of the nonmanufactured commodity. Labor is immobile across countries but mobile across sectors. 
Therefore, the wage rate in country i is Wi. Moreover, it follows that !i, the unit cost of the input bundle in country i, is equal to Wi : 
Stochastic technology shocks: In each period t = 0;1; : : :, the event st yields a realization for the stochastic technology level in each country, Ti 
 
st 
. In particular, it is assumed that the  in each country’s technology level obey a dynamic factor structure and can be decomposed, without 
loss of generality, as follows: 
lnTi 
 
st =  
 
st + i 
 
st; (11) where  
 
st captures the common component of the technology stochastic process, and i 
 
st 
denotes the country-speci portion of the technology stochastic process. Any positive correlation across Ti 
 
st 
, for 
i = 1; : : : ; K, is captured in the common component,  
 
st.6 
The common component  
 
st follows a serially correlated discrete Markov process. In partic- 
ular, we use a  state Markov process with states and transition probabilities set to approximate 
the continuous autoregressive model given by (up to a constant) 
 
 
st =  
 
st 
 1 
+  (st); 
(12) 
where  (st) is a normally distributed and zero-mean i:i:d: shock with standard deviation #. In turn, each country’s idiosyncratic technology component, i 
 
st 
, follows a serially correlated dis- crete stochastic process independent across countries. For the idiosyncratic components, we also 
use a  Markov process with states and transition probabilities set to approximate the 
continuous autoregressive model given by 
i 
 
st = i 
 
st 
 1 
+ i (st); 
(13) 
where i (st) is a normally distributed and zero mean i:i:d: shock with standard deviation #. 
6The common component is included so that the calibration matches the median level of cross-country correlations observed in the data. However, the common component is entirely exogenous and does not a the relation between trade intensity and business cycle synchronization.

========9========

Trade barriers and real exchange rate volatility: Fluctuations in the countries’ level of 
technology lead to  in the terms of trade and the real exchange rate. Moreover, it is 
clear that unless there are no trade costs, the law of one price does not hold for each intermediate 
commodity. The consumption-based real exchange rate between country j and country i is given by Qji 
 
st 
 
= Pi 
 
st=Pj 
 
st, where Pj 
 
st is the price of the  good in country j, given by (10). Thus, the real exchange rate can be expressed as 
 
h . i 
1= Qji st = i 
 
st j 
  
st : 
(14) 
It follows that the volatility of the real exchange rate falls as the trade costs become smaller. To 
illustrate this point, suppose ij = ji =   1. Imposing symmetry, the log real exchange rate can be approximated as follows 
 
logQji 
 
 
st  
1   
T  
 
j 
st 
 Ti 
 
st; 
where  is a positive constant. 
 
7 
Thus, the variance of the (log) real exchange rate is given by 
 
 
 
variance of logQji st = 
1   
 
2 
 
variance of T, (15) 
and it is immediately apparent that as  falls toward 1 the volatility of the real exchange rate 
falls towards zero. At high levels of trade costs, country-speci aggregate shocks translate into 
movements in the domestic price of intermediate commodities but do not imply movements in the 
foreign price of the commodity since the high trade costs allow producers to price discriminate. 
However, at low trade costs price discrimination is often precluded and the law of one price holds 
for many intermediate commodities. In turn, this implies a low volatility of the real exchange rate 
and, as we will see, the synchronization of business cycles.

2.2 Preferences 
The stand-in household in country i has preferences represented by a utility function of the form 
introduced by Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Hu (1988), given by

Ci; Ni;st = ln Ci 
 
st   
Ni 
 
s 
1+ 
1 +  
(16) 
where Ci and Ni are consumption and time spent working by the stand-in household, respectively. 
The parameter  is the inverse of the Frisch elasticity of labor supply and  > 0. The choice of 
preferences excludes wealth e and therefore excludes intertemporal substitution in the labor 
choice.8 For simplicity, we assume that there are no international  markets so that the 
bilateral trade balance between any country-pair must always be zero.9 Moreover, the country i 
 are owned fully by country i residents. Hence, the period budget constraint faced by the 
stand-in household in country i is 
Pi

where i

is independent of the source country i, the measure ji corresponds to country j’s expenditure 
on country i’s ditiated intermediate goods as a fraction of country j’s total expenditure

on ditiated intermediate goods. The bilateral trade intensity measure used in our study 
correspond to one of the measures proposed by FR, which is the sum of a country’s bilateral 
exports divided by the sum of each country’s aggregate net income. In our theoretical economy 
this is given by

Finally, as shown in Bernard et al. (2003), the aggregate share of costs in total revenue for the 
ditiated intermediate good producers in each country is given by =(1 + ).11 Therefore, the 
aggregate pro in country i are given by 
" #

st =

In equilibrium, aggregate expenditure on the  good, Ei

3 Trade and Synchronization in the Theoretical Economy 
We use a simulation approach to determine whether our model quantitatively reproduces the trade- 
comovement relation. We simulate several sets of time-series for the world economy and reproduce 
the FR regressions for each simulation. In this section, we describe the calibration used to evaluate 
the model and the main  
3.1 Calibration 
Before turning to the quantitative  we describe the targets informing the choice of param- 
eter values used to evaluate the theoretical economy. The number of countries K is set equal to 21 
to replicate the empirical analysis|implying 210 distinct country-pairs. 
The list of technology parameters that have to be determined includes the following: the elas- 
ticity of substitution between intermediate inputs ; the parameter that controls the level of  
heterogeneity ; the 420 trade-cost parameters ij for each i; j = 1; : : :21, with i 6 = j; the unit cost of the input bundle in each country !i; and the share of labor in the input bundle, . The  two parameters are chosen based on evidence in Bernard et al. (2003), who choose the parame- 
ters  and  matching the productivity and size advantage of exporters as in the U.S. plant-level 
data. In particular, the parameter  is chosen to match the productivity advantage of exporters, 
and the parameter  corresponds to the price elasticity of demand for ditiated intermediate 
commodities and therefore relates to the size advantage of exporting establishments. The values 
estimated by Bernard et al. (2003) for  and  are, respectively, 3.60 and 3.79 (see Table 1). 
[Table 1 about here] 
The trade-cost parameters ij are chosen to match each country-pair’s bilateral trade volume in the deterministic static-equilibrium, in which Ti 
 
st 
 
= 1 for all i and t. From equation (19) it 
follows that country j’s expenditure on intermediate commodities manufactured by country i as a 
share of country j’s total spending in manufactured commodities is denoted as: 
 ji 
(!iji) 
 
= 
PK 
(!iji) 
  
: 
i=1 
12 

========13========

If we consider for the purpose of calibration an approximately symmetric world economy (i.e. the 
same total expenditure in each country), it follows from equation (20) that the bilateral trade 
intensity between any country-pair j and i is given by (ji + ij)=2. Moreover, assuming !jij  !iji and

Finally, by normalizing the bilateral trade intensity between country j and country i by the

There are 210 distinct country-pairs and, hence, 420 equations such as (23).13 We use each of 
these equations to solve for the 420 trade costs ji, matching the bilateral trade intensities (see Table 12). A description of the data can be found in the Appendix A.1. Figure 1 illustrates the calibration’s  Despite the symmetry approximation (i.e., the approximation

data’s counterpart is 0.9965. The median bilateral trade intensity in the data is 0:0023 while in the 
simulation it is 0:0029.

Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of the calibrated iceberg costs. Table 2 shows the relation 
between the calibrated values of the iceberg trade costs and the empirical proxies for trade frictions 
that we use in Section 4|log distance, border dummy and language dummy. As can be seen, the 
relation between each of these variables and the iceberg costs has the expected sign. Moreover, the 
R2 of the regression is quite high: 66 percent. The correlation between the calibrated values of

However, they allow for an analytically tractable calibration, and Figure 1 shows that the approximation errors are very small.

results suggest that our calibrated values of iceberg costs capture well the empirical trade barriers. 
[Figure 2 about here] 
[Table 2 about here] 
The remaining technology parameters that need to be chosen are the unit cost of the input 
bundle in each country !i and the share of labor in the input bundle . The latter is set equal to 
0:21 following, once again, Bernard et al. (2003). The unit cost of the input bundle in each country is chosen so that the wage rate, given by Wi = !1=i , is equal to the real total compensation per employee obtained from the OECD and shown in Figure 3 (See Appendix A.1. for details). 
[Figure 3 about here] 
The remaining technology parameters that need to be chosen are the parameters of the stochas- 
tic process for the technology shocks. Three parameters need to be calibrated: the standard 
deviation of the innovations to the common component of technology and of the innovations to the 
idiosyncratic components (respectively, # and # ) and the autocorrelation coet , which is assumed to be the same for both the common and the idiosyncratic component. The choice of val- 
ues for the parameters of the stochastic processes for technology are informed by two targets. First, 
we choose parameter values so that the theoretical economy is consistent with quarterly aggregate 
time-series for the U.S. economy|in particular the volatility and autocorrelation of (log and H{P 
 output. 
14 
Second, we choose the standard deviation of the innovations to the common 
component of technology, #, to match the bilateral output correlation of the U.S. and Belgium (30.89 percent). We choose this specic bilateral correlation as a target because this country-pair 
bilateral trade share coincides with the median bilateral trade share (0.0023). The resulting value 
of the autocorrelation coet  is 0.8620 to match the autocorrelation of (log and H{P  
output in the data (86.20 percent). The parameter values for the innovations’ standard deviations 
# and # are, respectively, 0:0089 and 0:0143. 
14We use quarterly time-series to maintain consistency with the empirical results shown in Section 4, which we later use for comparison. 
14 

========15========

Finally, we need to  the labor supply elasticity parameter . The value for  is chosen so that 
the standard deviation of (log) hours relative to the standard deviation of (log) output is equal to its 
empirical counterpart (69.93 percent). This yields a value of  = 0:43. This value implies a Frisch 
labor supply elasticity of 2:33, which is too high compared with the usual estimates. However, 
our  regarding the model’s ability to match the relation between trade integration and 
business cycle synchronization do not change if we set the labor supply elasticity to unity, a more 
conventional choice. 
3.2 Findings 
This section examines whether higher trade intensity in the theoretical economy, resulting from 
lower transportation costs, leads to higher cross-country output correlations. We answer this ques- 
tion by proceeding as follows: We use our model of the world economy (composed of 21 countries) to 
simulate 500 replications of time series for output for each country and the bilateral trade shares for 
each country-pair.15 Next, we compute the output correlation for each country-pair, and examine 
the link between trade and business cycle synchronization in the theoretical economy. 
Table 3 shows the empirical properties of output and hours in the U.S., and the international 
business cycle correlations for comparison with the theoretical economy, which is calibrated to 
match the world’s bilateral trade shares. Overall, the theoretical economy matches the data well. 
Although the median bilateral output correlation in the simulated world economy is relatively close 
to its empirical counterpart, the distribution of output correlations is much more concentrated in 
the simulated data than in the actual data. This may indicate that some dimensions of the data 
are omitted in the theoretical economy. 
[Table 3 about here] 
Figure 4 provides a  insight into whether the model replicates the empirical relation between 
trade and comovement. It compares the empirical data (panels (a) and (b)) with the simulated 
data from the theoretical economy (panels (c) and (d)). Panels (a) and (c) illustrate the relation 
between trade intensity and business cycle synchronization, and panels (b) and (d) illustrate the

relation between trade intensity and the real exchange rate volatility. Clearly, the theoretical model 
of the world economy is successful at qualitatively replicating the positive relation between business 
cycle synchronization and trade intensity and the negative relation between trade intensity and real 
exchange rate volatility. 
[Figure 4 about here] 
In fact, in the theoretical economy, these two relations are closely linked because of the presence 
of trade costs, which lead to failures of the law of one price for the intermediate commodities. In 
particular, deviations from relative PPP at the aggregate level arise as a result of the decisions 
by individual  to price to market. When the trade costs are absent, price discrimination is 
not possible and the law of one price holds for each intermediate commodity; therefore, business 
cycles are perfectly synchronized. However, with higher trade costs, intermediate producers are 
able to charge dit prices in dit countries. Pricing-to-market by intermediate-good  
leads to violations of the law of one price. Moreover, higher bilateral trade costs obviously reduce 
the bilateral trade intensity. Therefore, higher trade costs simultaneously raise real exchange rate 
volatility|as indicated by equation (15)|and decrease business cycle synchronization. 
In order to compare the potential of our model to generate high business cycle correlations 
between countries with stronger trade linkages, we use the simulated data to estimate the following 
regression equation: 
 
 
ji =  +  
Bilateral trade intensity between j and i 
+ ji; 
(24) 
where ji is the correlation between (log) output in country j and in country i. We consider the level of bilateral trade intensity in addition to the logarithm, as suggested by Kose and Yi (2006). 
Kose and Yi (2006) recommend this speci because they judge that the relation between 
business cycle synchronization and trade is not a semi-log relation. As they put it, the semi-log 
speci implies that an increase in trade intensity from 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent would have 
the same impact on GDP correlation as an increase in trade intensity from 20 percent to 40 percent, 
which is counter-factual and inconsistent with the international business cycle model. 
Table 4 reports the estimates for the coet  using the simulated data. The table shows 
both the level regression results and the semi-log regression. The  coets are 3.520 and 0.028 
16 

========17========

for the level and semi-log regressions, respectively. 
[Table 4 about here] 
3.3 Interpretation of the Findings 
Country-speci technology shocks propagate internationally by lowering the price of the interme- 
diate commodities and, therefore, increasing ency in the production of the  good across 
countries. In particular, two factors combine to explain why the lower the trade barriers are the 
stronger the propagation of the country-speci shocks. First, with lower trade barriers, the level 
of vertical specialization increases; therefore, there is more scope for each country to bene from 
favorable foreign technology shocks. Second, for a given level of vertical specialization, the e 
ciency gains following a favorable shock are more likely to be transmitted. This follows from the 
fact that when trade barriers are lower, foreign exporters are compelled by their competitors to 
pass through the favorable technology shocks, implying lower export prices. The upshot is that 
when trade barriers are lower, the price of the imported intermediate commodities is more likely to 
fall following a positive foreign technology shock because foreign exporters are forced to lower their 
export prices. Hence, country-speci shocks are better transmitted with lower trade barriers. 
What happens to real exchange rate volatility? The mechanism explaining the positive associ- 
ation between trade integration and real exchange rate volatility is the same. Given that the al 
good sector is perfectly competitive, the reduction in the price of intermediate inputs translates 
fully into a lower price of the al good. With low trade barriers, the country-speci shocks 
propagate across countries strongly because vertical specialization is high and the transmission of 
foreign shocks through lower intermediate input prices is easy. Therefore, the prices of the  
good in each country move together. The result is that when trade barriers are low, real exchange 
rate volatility is low. 
Hence, the model predicts: (i) A negative relation between trade barriers and business cycle 
synchronization; and (ii) a positive relation between real exchange rate volatility and trade barriers.

4 Relation Between Trade and Comovement: Model vs Data 
In this subsection, we reproduce the well-known empirical link between trade integration and busi- 
ness cycle synchronization shown in FR. Our results con the positive and signit relation 
between trade and comovement. We also estimate an augmented version of the FR benchmark 
regression that controls for both  integration and trade intensity. In this case the posi- 
tive link between trade and comovement remains robust. However, the et of trade intensity on 
comovement is attenuated once we control for  integration.16 
We then assess the potential of our model to replicate the empirical relation between trade and 
comovement. Our  indicate that our theoretical model explains up to 41 percent of the 
empirical relation between trade intensity and business cycle synchronization. In this way, it is 
successful in solving the trade-comovement puzzle. 
Our model outlined in Section 2 contains two other predictions. First, correlations should be 
lower for countries with higher trade costs. Second, exchange rate volatility is higher for countries 
with higher trade costs. We provide empirical evidence supporting this link. 
4.1 Link Between Trade Integration and Comovement 
In this subsection we replicate the estimation method of FR on our data and sample period. Our 
estimated regression is as follows: 
 ji =  +  ln T radeji 
 
+ "ji; 
(25) 
 where ji is the GDP correlation between country j and country i, ln T radeji 
 
is the logarithm 
of the average bilateral trade intensity measure, and "ji is an error term. Moreover, as suggested by Kose and Yi (2006), we estimate a second equation, given by 
ji =  +  T rade 
ji 
+ "ji; 
(26) 
where instead of using the measure of trade intensity in logs, we consider the level of trade intensity. 
When we later compare the data to our theoretical economy, the benchmark we use for comparison 
is the levels regression, although we also report results for the semi-log regression for completeness. 
16As highlighted later this point was addressed by Imbs (2004). 
18 

========19========

In any case, we are interested in the sign and magnitude of the regression coet . A 
positive  indicates that increased trade integration generates more synchronized business cycles. 
However, the OLS estimation of equations (25) and (26) is likely to be biased.17 
The issues of 
simultaneous causation and omitted variable bias are likely to be serious given that trade integration 
is endogenous. For this reason we use a GMM instrumental variable estimator to identify the e 
of trade integration on business cycle correlation. The instrumental variables used are in accordance 
with the gravity model of trade. In particular, we use the natural logarithm of distance between 
the business centers of the country-pairs, a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 when the 
countries share a common border, and a dummy variable that indicates if the country-pair shares 
a common language. Each of these variables is expected to be correlated with bilateral trade but 
uncorrelated with other conditions that may act bilateral correlations. We show the OLS results 
in Table 5. The instrumental variable (IV) results including the  regression are presented 
in Tables 6 and 7. 
4.2 Estimation 
The OLS estimates of  in Table 5 indicate that there is a positive association between trade 
integration and comovement. The specication (in levels) is shown in column (1) and the semi-log 
speci in column (2). The coet  takes the value 10.864 in the levels regression and 
0.090 in the log regression. 
Finally, we notice that the residuals in regressions (1) and (2) are correlated with the level 
of trade intensity.18 This implies the presence of an endogeneity bias; hence, in what follows we 
explore the IV regressions. 
As expected, the IV estimation results are in line with the OLS estimation and are actually 
stronger. Table 6 presents the  regression of bilateral trade intensity on our three IVs. The 
estimates in columns (1) and (2) support the predictions of the gravity model of trade. Distance 
has a negative e on trade intensity, and countries tend to trade more when they share a border 
or have a common language. 
[Table 5 about here] 
17We nevertheless report the OLS regression results below. 18These results are not reported. 
19 

========20========

[Table 6 about here] 
Table 7 shows the IV estimates of the  coet. Overall, the IV estimates of  con the 
seminal result by FR: Trade intensity has a positive and signit e on GDP correlation. Our 
benchmark speci in levels yields a coet equal to 17.250 (column (1)). For the semi-log 
speci the  coet is 0.102 (column (2)). 
The slope coet from the level regression implies that a doubling of the median trade 
intensity (a level increase of 0.0023) is associated with an increase in GDP correlation of 0.0397. 
In the log regression, the  coet implies that doubling the trade intensity leads to an increase 
of 0.069 in GDP correlations. Our estimates are slightly higher than those generally reported in 
the literature. For example, Kose and Yi’s (2006) estimates imply increases in GDP correlations 
of 0.029 for the levels regression and 0.063 for the logs regression.19 By contrast, FR’s estimates 
imply that doubling trade intensity increases GDP correlations by 0.033. 
[Table 7 about here] 
4.2.1 Accounting for Financial Integration 
In their empirical work, FR control only for bilateral trade intensity. As noted by Imbs (2004), 
international trade plays a relatively moderate role in transmitting business cycles across countries 
after controlling for  integration and patterns of specialization. This result has important 
implications for the relation we are assessing. Thus, we estimate an augmented version of equation 
(26) that includes a measure of  integration: 
ji =  +  T rade 
ji 
+  F in 
ji 
+ "ji; 
(27) 
where F inji is the bilateral cross-country bank stock of assets and liabilities divided by the sum of the countries’ GDP. We estimate Equation (27) using IVs. Portes and Rey (2005) show that gravity 
variables explain international transactions in  assets and goods.20 Therefore, we use this 
result to also instrument F inji using distance, border and language. For the sake of completeness, we also estimate the semi-log model. 
19One source of di is the data span. Kose and Yi (2006) consider data from 1970-2000. 
20Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2008) show that country portfolios are strongly biased towards trade partners. They also  that gravity variables such as distance and common language are associated with bilateral asset holdings. 
20 

========21========

The  results are shown in columns (3) and (4) of Table 6. Overall, we con that 
the gravity variables are good instruments for the level of  integration. The R2 is high and, 
except for the border dummy variable, all the covariates are signit. In particular, distance has 
a negative and signit e on  integration, while language has a signit positive 
e 
The results of the IV estimation are shown in Table 8. The regression in column (3) yields 
a signicant e of trade on output correlation. However, compared with the IV model that 
does not include nancial integration (shown in Table 7), the  coet drops substantially, from 
17.250 to 8.537. Moreover,  integration has a positive and signit e on business cycle 
synchronization.21 By contrast, the log regression presented in column (4) yields a  coet 
equal to 0.106, which is similar to the one reported in Table 7. Thus, the IV estimate of  in the 
model with  integration seems robust. 
[Table 8 about here] 
4.3 Quantitative Assessment of the Relation Between Trade and Comovement 
In this subsection, we compare the average FR regression coet obtained using the simulated 
data with the empirical counterpart. Table 9 summarizes the empirical estimates of the coet 
, and compares it with the coet obtained using the simulated data in Section 3. In the 
level regression, we see that the OLS estimate of  for the simulated data is about one-third of the 
size of the OLS coet for the empirical data|it is 10.864 for the data, compared with 3.520 
for the theoretical economy. Thus, if we assume the OLS model is well speci our benchmark 
theoretical economy explains 32 percent of the empirical relation. Figure 4 considers the linear 
regression equation (24) estimated using the simulated data from the theoretical economy and 
contrasts it with the empirical relation between trade intensity and output correlations. 
[Table 9 about here] 
21These results agree with those of Imbs (2006), who  a positive association between  integration and GDP correlation. 
21 

========22========

However, there are reasons to believe that the simple OLS model is inappropriate. Trade 
intensity is, of course, endogenous and many potential determinants of bilateral trade (e.g., bilateral 
exchange rate regime,  integration) are likely to in business cycle synchronization. 
Indeed, it is clear from the scatter plot in Figure 4a that the residuals of the OLS regression 
are not independent of the explanatory variable. Therefore, the coet  in equation (24), 
which is estimated in the sample of the simulated data, should be compared with the empirical 
instrumental variable counterpart. Table 9 addresses this comparison. The baseline model|labeled 
(1)|is estimated by GMM, instrumenting with the usual gravity variables. While the theoretical 
economy explains 32 percent of the OLS relation, it explains only about 20 percent of the relation 
estimated using IVs. 
An important potential source of omitted variable bias is related to the level of  inte- 
gration. Indeed, the analysis by Imbs (2004) indicates that countries with strong  links 
are signitly more synchronized. Moreover, as discussed previously, many of the determinants 
of trade also contribute to explain the level of  links. Hence, not including this variable 
may be an important source of bias. Therefore, instead of the baseline regression, we consider a 
second specieled (2)|that controls for the level of  integration. Once again, 
we consider the OLS and the GMM estimates of , the coet on trade intensity. The ex- 
planatory power of the model increases once we control for the level of  integration. In 
particular, the model explains 41 percent of the IV relation between trade intensity and business 
cycle synchronization, after controlling for the level of  integration. 
[Figure 5 about here] 
[Figure 6 about here] 
The importance of controlling for the level of  integration is well illustrated by Figures 5 
and 6, which compare the empirical relation with the theoretical economy’s predicted relation 
between bilateral trade intensity and business cycle synchronization. The scatter plot in Figure 5 
clearly shows that the best linear predictor of the empirical data points is far from the 95 percent 
con interval corresponding to the model’s predicted relation between trade and comovement. 
The slope of the empirical best linear predictor is very dit from the slope of the theoretical 
22 

========23========

economy’s best linear predictor. However, if there are omitted variables, the model is misspeci 
Therefore, we control for the level of  integration. The importance of doing this can be 
seen from Figure 6. The scatter points show in the vertical axis the adjusted bilateral correlation, 
corresponding to the predicted value for the bilateral correlation after controlling for the dis

+^bIV2 Average  integration 
 
 
 
Fin. integration between j and i 
; 
where \Average  integration" is the sample average of the bilateral  integration measure and 
^bIV 
are the IV coet estimates. The  shows that if country-pairs did not vary in 
their bilateral levels of  integration, the best linear  of the data would be within the 95 
percent con interval for the theoretical economy’s predicted relation between trade intensity 
and business cycle synchronization. The slope of the empirical best linear predictor (equal to 3.282) 
is very close to the slope of the best linear predictor for the simulated economy (equal to 3.520). 
Thus, the  of the theoretical model improves substantially once we control for the level of  
integration. 
Finally, the right side of Table 9 considers the semi-log speci Overall, the  are 
not very dit from the model in levels. In particular, the OLS regression coet for the 
theoretical economy is about 31 percent of the empirical counterpart and the IV coet is 27 
percent. Overall, we believe the model in levels is more reliable, although the quantitative  
are not too sensitive to the choice of model speci The model explains between 20 percent 
and 41 percent of the empirical relation between trade and business cycle synchronization. 
4.4 Trade Barriers, Comovement and Real Exchange Rate Volatility 
Our theoretical model predicts that countries with higher trade costs will be associated with lower 
GDP correlations and higher real exchange rate volatility. In order to assess these predictions we 
construct an empirical measure of trade costs based on Novy (2008), (see Appendix A.2 for details). 
We estimate the following regression: 
ji =  + tcji + "ji; 
(28) 
where the variable labeled tcji is the trade cost between country j and country i. 
23 

========24========

The results in Table 10 indicate a negative association between trade costs and business cycle 
synchronization. This relation is important for our explanation of the trade-comovement link. 
Speci, if the presence of trade barriers reduces trade and decouples the international business 
cycle, then we would expect higher trade costs to be associated with lower output correlation. 
[Table 10 about here] 
We also estimate 
rervolji =  + tcji + "ji; 
(29) 
where rervolji is the volatility of the real exchange rate between country j and country i. The results con that trade barriers increase real exchange rate volatility, as predicted by our theoretical 
model. 
5 Conclusion 
The positive relation between trade intensity and business cycle comovement has been documented 
in a broad literature. However, it is di for theoretical models to replicate this relation. 
We developed a multi-country international business cycle model with vertical trade linkages, 
imperfect competition, and endogenous markups. We investigated whether this framework can 
account for the trade comovement puzzle identi by Kose and Yi (2001) and Kose and Yi (2006). 
In particular, we carefully calibrated a model of the world economy consisting of 21 countries. The 
model’s trade costs are calibrated to match each country-pair’s bilateral trade volume { that is, 210 
country-pairs. The resulting calibrated trade costs are correlated as expected with the standard 
proxies for trade costs in the gravity model. We show that the model successfully at addresses the 
trade-comovement puzzle. In terms of matching the data, our model explains at most 41 percent 
of the responsiveness of comovement to trade integration. 
In their empirical work, FR control for only bilateral trade intensity. Other researchers, espe- 
cially Imbs (2004), note that international trade plays a relatively moderate role in transmitting 
business cycles across countries after controlling for  integration and patterns of specializa- 
tion. We augment the FR regression to include  integration. We  that (i) the impact of 
24 

========25========

trade intensity on comovement is attenuated when we control for  linkages and (ii)  
cial integration has a positive impact on comovement. We also show that gravity variables explain 
international transactions in  assets. Given these results, an extension to our model that 
includes  linkages o a promising avenue for future research.

A Appendix 
A.1 Data 
We consider a sample of 21 OECD countries composed of the United States (US), United Kingdom 
(UK), Austria (AT), Belgium (BE), Denmark (DK), France (FR), Germany (DE), Italy (IT), 
Netherlands (NL), Norway (NO), Sweden (SW), Switzerland (CH), Canada (CA), Japan (JP), 
Finland (FI), Greece (GR), Ireland (IR), Portugal (PT), Spain (SP), Australia (AS) and New 
Zealand (NZ) over the period 1974{2007. The variable de and data sources are as follows: 
Correlation: We use real GDP, measured quarterly, to capture economic activity and com- 
pute the correlations between each country-pair, j and i, (labeled ji). We  transform real GDP by taking the natural logarithm. Since we are interested in business cycle  we 
detrend it using the H-P er. GDP data are from the OECD (transaction B1 GE) using mea- 
sure VPVOBARSA (USD, volume estimates,  PPPs, OECD reference year, annual levels, 
seasonally adjusted). 
Trade intensity: We measure trade intensity between each country pair, j and i, (labeled 
T radeji) normalizing bilateral trade|that is, the sum of each country’s imports from the other| by the sum of nominal GDP in the two countries, averaged over the entire period. Exports and 
imports data, denominated in dollars, are taken from the IMF Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS). 
We normalized trade by nominal GDP. The series was from the OECD (transaction B1 GE), and 
the measure was CXC (USD current prices current exchange rates) 
Financial integration: Bilateral bank stock of assets and liabilities data, measured quarterly 
and denominated in U.S. dollars, are from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) Locational 
Banking Statistics Database. We normalized the stock of assets and liabilities by nominal GDP. 
Gravity variables: The following variables are from Andrew Rose’s website: distance between 
business centers, common language dummy, and border dummy.22 
Real exchange rate volatility: Real exchange rate volatility is measured by calculating the 
standard deviation of the quarterly series, detrended using the H-P  The nominal exchange 
rate series were retrieved from Haver, and the source is the Federal Reserve Board. Consumer 
prices are from the OECD MEI database. The variable is \Consumer Prices - All Items".

Wages: Total annual compensation is from the OECD’s National Accounts Database. The 
measure is C (national currency, current prices) and the transaction is D1 (compensation of em- 
ployees). These values are divided by total employment to get total compensation per employee 
The variable is ET (total employment) in the OECD’s Economic Outlook No. 87. Germany is 
missing data before 1991, so the German total employment data is extrapolated using the series

data are de using CPI data (all items) from the OECD (Dateset: Price Indices) using 2000 
as the base year, and then converted to dollars using the 2000 USD exchange rate from the Federal 
Reserve Board. 
Summary statistics of the basic data are presented in Table 11. The median bilateral trade 
intensity over all countries and all years is 0.0023 and the standard deviation is 0.0080. Thus, as 
noticed by Kose and Yi (2006), the bilateral trade ws between the typical country-pair are small. 
As shown in Table 11, the level of dispersion in the output correlations is substantial. The 
median level is about 30 percent, but the standard deviation is just above 20 percent. 
[Table 11 about here] 
A.2 Methodology to Compute Trade Costs 
Bilateral trade costs were calculated to correspond with equation (8) in Novy (2008). The equation 
is 
ij = 
xiix jj 1 
2(  1) xijxji 
 1; 
where ij is the bilateral trade cost between countries i and j, xii (xjj) represents the trade of country i (j) with itself, xij(xji) is exports from country i to j (j to i), and  is the elasticity of 
substitution across goods. We assume  to be 3.79, in line with the calibration of our model (see 
Table 1). Novy (2008) follows Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) and assumes that  equals 8. 
The results are not sensitive to the value of .

A.2.1 Computation of Intranational Trade 
Intranational trade is calculated as a country’s total output less its exports to the world. Following 
the methodology of Wei (1996), GDP is adjusted by the ratio of output to value added and the 
goods share of GDP to obtain total output. The equation for intranational trade is: 
xii = iiGDPi 
 xiw; 
where GDPi is GDP of country i, xiw are exports from country i to the world and i.and i.are the ratio of output to value added and goods share of GDP in country i, respectively. 
A.2.2 Data sources 
For xij and xji we used the DOTS bilateral export data from the IMF, described in A1. 
xii and xjj are calculated using data on exports to the world (same IMF DOTS data used before) and GDP data pulled from the OECD national accounts database (measure CXC (USD, 
current prices, current exchange rates), transaction B1 GA (GDP, output approach). 
Data on gross output and value added for the total economy is pulled from the OECD’s STAN 
database (variables PROD and VALU, respectively). Goods GDP is computed as the sum of 
transactions B1GA B (Agriculture, hunting and forestry,  B1GC E (Industry), and B1GF 
(Construction). In order to maximize the coverage of trade costs across time and country pairs 
the assumption of a constant ratio of output to value added and goods share of GDP was adopted, 
where i = 5=2 and i = 1=3 for all i. These values were informed by the available data and, in particular, the value for i  in the middle of the range of values calculated by Wei(1996) for the ratio of output to value added. Ultimately, the trade cost analysis is not a by the decision 
to  i and i. Bilateral trade costs computed precisely from the data show a 97% and higher correlation with those computed under the  ratios. 
A.3 Analytical Results 
This appendix describes how we obtained the analytical results provided in the paper. Many of 
these derivations, in particular in sections A.3.3 and A.3.4, are adapted from Bernard et al. (2003).
