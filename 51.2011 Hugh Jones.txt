How to Waste a Crisis: Budget Cuts and 
Public Service Reform 
David Hugh-Jones 
07/27/2011 
Abstract 
In the aftermath of the ﬁnancial crisis, governments have proposed sav- 
ing money by reforming public services. This paper argues that tight budget 
constraints make reform harder. Governments are uncertain which depart- 
ments are effective. Normally, effective departments can be identiﬁed by 
increasing their budget, since they can use the increase to produce more 
than ineffective departments. When budgets must be cut, however, ineffec- 
tive departments can mimic effective ones by reducing their output. Budget 
cuts thus harm both short-run productive efﬁciency, and long-run allocative 
efﬁciency. These predictions are conﬁrmed in a panel of US libraries. Low 
marginal productivity libraries reduce output by more than expected in re- 
sponse to a budget cut, and budget setters respond less to observed short-run 
output elasticity after cutback years.

As government borrowing ballooned in the wake of the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, an 
era of deﬁcit reduction and tight budget constraints beckoned. But political ﬁgures 
around the world looked for the silver lining. Rahm Emmanuel remarked: “You 
never want a serious crisis to go to waste” (Wall Street Journal, 2008). Hillary 
Clinton told young Europeans: “Never waste a good crisis” (Independent, 2009). 
And Barack Obama exhorted the American nation “to discover great opportunity 
in the midst of great crisis” (USA Today, 2009). On the other side of the Atlantic, 
management consultants urged the public sector to “us[e] the downturn as a cata- 
lyst” to “embrace innovation and rethink delivery models” (Deloitte, 2009), while 
David Cameron described public service modernization as “not an alternative to 
dealing with our debts – it’s a key part of it” (Cameron, 2011). 
These inspiring slogans are capable of multiple interpretations, but one central 
one, best expressed by the Cameron quote, is that periods of austerity are the right 
times for reform. Ordinarily, politicians face few incentives to examine public 
sector budgets for waste and inefﬁciency. When budgets are constrained, how- 
ever, they need to inspect the books more closely, trim dead wood programs, and 
emerge with a slimmer but more effective government. 
This paper explores these issues, with the aim of extending our comprehension 
of the relationship between budget constraints and efﬁcient allocations. It gives 
one reason why the hopes expressed above may not be borne out. In the model 
presented here, savings do not, in general, promote efﬁciency. Instead, there is a 
trade-off between savings and efﬁciency, which bites particularly hard when bud-

gets are tight. The logic is one of signalling. Governments are unsure a priori 
which departments are spending public money effectively. In good times, a gov- 
ernment can identify effective departments by increasing their budget on a trial 
basis. Efﬁcient departments will then be able to do more than inefﬁcient ones 
with the extra money. In bad times, however, the government cannot afford to ex- 
pand the budget. It would like to cut the budget of ineffective but over-resourced 
departments, whose output will be least affected by the cuts. But such depart- 
ments cannot be identiﬁed by trial cuts, because by working inefﬁciently, they can 
make it appear that any cut is very harmful. 
The argument is illustrated below in Figure 1. The x axis measures a bureaucratic 
department’s budget. The y axis measures the department’s output – a (presum- 
ably public) good such as miles of roads maintained, library books lent out, or 
heart operations performed. A government in ofﬁce observes a single point in 
these two dimensions: the current budget (SQ) and the current output. From the 
government’s point of view, this is the point where a set of counterfactual lines 
cross. In other words, decision-makers must answer the question: “what would 
happen if we raised, or cut, this department’s budget?” Correspondingly, the bu- 
reaucratic departments is one of two possible kinds.1 It may be a high marginal 
productivity type (“high type” for short), whose output will be greatly increased 
by extra money, and be seriously harmed by cuts. Or it may be a “low” marginal 
productivity type, which will gain less from extra cash and be harmed less by 
cuts. Departmental productivity could differ in this way for many reasons. De- 
partments may vary in their efﬁciency, and face tasks and external environments 
1The simplifying assumption of two types is used throughout; the logic extends simply to a continuum of types.

of varying difﬁculty. Or, the social value of the task they do may be uncertain; 
some aspects of the task are highly valuable, others less so, and it is hard to un- 
tangle these. Since the government may not be able to observe all these factors, it 
may be unsure of the effects of changes to the budget. 
Ex ante, there is no reason that the potential output curves of the two types should 
cross precisely at the current budget. Instead, we can presume that there is a larger 
set of possible types; the observation of the status quo budget and output then rules 
out all but those types whose budget lines pass through that point. Thus, I assume 
that the government does have reasonable information about the department’s cur- 
rent performance. So, for example, the government may know how many miles of 
road were built in the current year, but be less sure about how many miles could 
be built with a 10% increase or cut in the budget: exactly how much can costs be 
driven down in negotiations with contractors? Or, reliable crime ﬁgures may be 
recorded, but it may be unclear how they would be affected by an increase or cut 
in the budget for policing. 
These assumptions exclude, on the one hand, bureaucratic activities whose value 
is intrinsically hard to measure, such as public funding of the arts, or activities 
whose outputs are not immediately experienced, such as children’s education; and 
on the other hand, activities with clear outputs that are also offered in compet- 
itive markets at public prices, such as perhaps the purchase of IT equipment or 
stationery. 
In forming estimates of potential outputs for different budgets, governments may 
have more history to go on than a single data point. However, since bureaucratic 
capacities, external conditions and the social value of outputs all change over time, 
4 

========5========

the government will still face some uncertainty over the bureaucracy’s production 
possibility frontier; this uncertainty will be lowest for relatively recent data; and, 
since most budget changes are incremental, this data will probably involve budget 
inputs close to the current one. For simplicity, I therefore assume that output at the 
current budget is known for sure, with uncertainty increasing as we move farther 
from this point. 
Suppose that the long-run cost of the government’s funds is given as in the curved 
line in the picture. Then, the optimal budget for a high type department would be 
at point B, where marginal beneﬁt is equal to marginal cost – an increase on the 
current budget. The optimal budget for a low type department would be a cut to 
point A. 
One way to ﬁnd out the quality of the department would be to increase the budget 
for a short time, for example to point B itself. Suppose that the bureaucracy is a 
single actor, who can costlessly produce any output up to the line for the depart- 
ment’s type, and who is solely interested in maximizing the departmental budget 
à la Niskanen (1971).2 With the extra cash, a high type department can produce 
strictly higher output than the low type department could. By doing so, the bu- 
reaucrat can demonstrate the department’s competence and continue to receive 
a higher budget in future. A low type department, on the other hand, can only 
produce up to its output line. After the trial period, efﬁcient long-term budget 
allocations can be made, according to the department’s type, at either A or B. 
Now, however, suppose that the government faces a tight short-run budget con- 
straint. For example, it may have entered ofﬁce with high government borrowing 
2This is a simpliﬁcation (Dunleavy, 1985), but it may not be an unrealistic one if interpreted within the context of protecting an existing budget from cuts.

left over from the previous administration, and bond markets nervous about its 
ability to repay. Or, a particular minister may have been allocated a low budget by 
the Prime Minister. Say that the maximum budget available for the trial period is 
below the status quo budget SQ. 
The situation is now very different, because a high type department can no longer 
perform better than a low type department could. Since the high type’s marginal 
productivity at current output is higher, it will be more affected by the budget 
cut. Even when the high type performs at its maximum, the low type can match 
it by costlessly lowering its output. In other words, over-resourced bureaucrats 
can claim that they are more harmed by budget cuts than they really are, simply 
by reducing their productivity. As a result, in the short run there will be produc- 
tive inefﬁciency due to destroyed output; in the long run, departments cannot be 
distinguished, and there will be allocational inefﬁciency. 
The idea that bureaucrats may respond to budget cuts by exaggerating, or even 
deliberately aggravating, their effects is part of the folk wisdom of public admin- 
istration. The tactic is known as “sore thumbs”, “bleeding stumps”, or in the US 
as the Washington Monument Ploy, named after the US Park Service’s regular 
threats to close the Washington Monument if their budget were to be cut. Wil- 
davsky (1979 [1964] p.102) mentions “cut the popular program” as a strategy 
for agencies seeking to reverse budget cuts. Several authors in Hood and Wright 
(1982) describe the bleeding stumps tactic; as the editors put it, “the course of 
retrenchment is fatally distorted by bureaucratic preferences”. The current round 
of post-crisis budgets has led to other examples. In 2008, California governor 
Arnold Schwarzenegger rhetorically proposed a budget which included the early 
7 

========8========

release of 37,000 prisoners. Eric Pickles (the current UK Secretary of State for 
Communities and Local Government) has accused Labour local authorities of op- 
erating a “bleeding stumps strategy” (BBC, 2011). However, the distortions of 
retrenchment go beyond the direct effects of shirking by ill-motivated bureaucra- 
cies. At least as important is the information loss because the government – the 
principal in this situation – cannot identify the truly essential programs, where 
cuts will seriously harm the provision of public services. While the loss from 
shirking is immediate, the information loss is more long-term and may outlast the 
crisis period. And, of course, the information loss occurs even when the bureau- 
cracy is not shirking at all, but is genuinely damaged by cuts. The theory here also 
clariﬁes why stories of “bleeding stumps” emerge in times of cutbacks and not of 
growth: the Washington Monument ploy can be used when the government must 
cut spending, but there is no corrresponding tactic for when budgets are going up. 
Below the model is developed in detail. The empirics examine a panel of US 
libraries. The data bear out the model’s prediction that low marginal productivity 
bureaucracies will be more likely to underperform in years when their budget is 
cut, while high marginal productivity bureaucracies will be less affected. They 
also support the notion of long-run allocational inefﬁciency: decision-makers’ 
budget allocations are less sensitive to observed bureaucratic performance after a 
budget cut. 
Model 
There is a single bureaucracy, which is either a high-productivity type, or a low- 
productivity type. Given a budget of x, the high type can produce output to a 
8 

========9========

maximum value of aH +bHx, while the low type can produce aL +bLx with 
bL < bH.3 This output level can be thought of as the result of an underlying 
decision problem among the bureau’s personnel. For instance, output beyond 
the default level (aH or aL) might be produced by hiring homogenous workers 
at a unit cost of 1, who produce at bH or bL depending on the efﬁciency of the 
department’s technology. Or, different types of bureaucrats may trade off work 
and on-the-job leisure differently. However, the bureaucracy may also make the 
political choice to produce output lower than the maximum. For example, the 
bureaucracy’s manager may allocate money inefﬁciently so that output is lost. 
Producing output below the maximum has a positive cost, since it involves (for 
example) reorganizing work routines so as to be less efﬁcient, or consuming more 
leisure than is optimal. I assume for simplicity that this cost is small.4 
Current spending is at a default level ¯x and output is ¯y, where ¯y = aH +bHx¯ = 
aL +bLx¯ is the point at which both output lines cross. As argued above, this 
is not a coincidence: the government’s observation of current productivity can 
be thought of as reducing its uncertainty over the bureaucracy’s output function, 
perhaps from a much larger set of types. 
Rather than imposing a hard budget constraint as above, I assume the government 
faces a short-term cost of funds ˆc(x) = kc(x). Marginal cost is increasing, since 
the government’s credit in the markets is not unlimited, and since there are com- 
3The linear functional form is not essential: concave output and a weakly convex cost of funds would give similar results. The important condition is that the types’ output curves cross only once, at the status quo point. 
4Relaxing this assumption would have predictable effects. As the cost of producing below the optimum grows, it becomes harder for the low type bureaucracy to pool in the case of budget cuts. Since this cost is difﬁcult to observe empirically, introducing it as a parameter would add little to the model’s explanatory value.

peting spending priorities. The parameter k reﬂects how these conditions may 
vary. When there are many competing priorities and funds are tight, or when the 
government must pay high interest to borrow, k will be high. I assume c0;c00 > 0, 
c(0) = 0 and c0(x) ! 0 as x ! 0. The long-term cost of funds is just c(x). 
The timing is as follows: 
1. Nature draws the bureaucracy’s type t 2 fH;Lg which is high (H) with 
probability p. 
2. The government chooses a ﬁrst-period budget x1 at a cost kc(x1). 
3. The bureaucracy chooses a level of output y1  at +btx1. Inefﬁcient levels 
of output y1 < at +btx1 may be achieved by, for example, allocating funds 
to inefﬁcient uses. 
4. The government observes y1 and chooses a second-period budget x2 at a 
cost c(x2). 
5. The bureaucracy produces y2 = at +btx2.5 
6. Payoffs are realised. The bureaucracy receives dx1 +x2 and the govern- 
ment’s utility is d[y1 
 kc(x1)]+y2 
 c(x2). Here d is a parameter reﬂecting 
the relative length of the ﬁrst period, in other words the time until output 
becomes accurately measurable. This time may be greater for some outputs 
than for others. 
6 
5Second period productive efﬁciency is guaranteed by the bureaucracy’s small cost of destroy- ing output. 
6For instance, the effectiveness of infrastructure investment may take longer to become clear than the effectiveness of hardship payments to Old Age Pensioners. Recent British governments have invested extensively in performance management statistics for local authorities, health and education. 
10 

========11========

We ﬁrst look for conditions in which the government can distinguish the types 
after the ﬁrst period. If this is so, the second period budget will be xH solving 
c0(xH) = bH for a high type and xL solving c0(xL) = bL for a low type. Since 
xH > xL, each type of bureaucracy would prefer to appear like the high type. For 
x1  x¯, because the low type’s maximum possible output exceeds the high type’s, 
the low type can match any output that the high type could produce. Thus it must 
be that x1 > x¯. Then the high type bureaucracy can exceed any possible output of 
the low type, and so identify itself to the government, by producing efﬁciently. 
So for a high enough ﬁrst period budget, types can always be distinguished. How- 
ever, if the short-run cost of funds is large, the government may prefer not to 
do so. The short-run optimum budget allocation, ignoring the second period and 
assuming that both types of bureaucrat produce efﬁciently, would be x1 solving 
c0(x1) = 
pbH + (1 
k 
 p)bL: 
(1) 
If x1 >x¯ then the short-run optimum will also allow the government to distinguish 
the types. But if k is large enough this will no longer hold. The government then 
faces a choice: keep the budget high in the ﬁrst period in order to observe the 
bureaucracy’s type, or spend less and fail to do so. 
Keeping the budget high requires allocating x1 = x¯ in the ﬁrst period.7 The gov- 
7In fact, to learn the department’s type we require 
x1 > x¯. This open set has no minimum, so the government’s optimal choice may not be well-deﬁned. This is a purely technical point, and I simply assume that the government must pay some arbitrarily small extra amount above x¯ to differentiate the types. An alternative ﬁx would be to add some noise to the department’s output. In this case, larger budget increments above ¯x would give continuously more accurate signals of deparmental type, and the optimal budget would trade off signal accuracy against period 1 optimality, typically coming in strictly above ¯x. This suggests an information-based rationale for cycles in spending levels, but the logic is not pursued further here.

ernment’s expected total payoff is then 
d[y¯ 
 kc(x¯)] +p(yH 
 c(xH)) + (1 
 p)(yL 
 c(xL)) 
(2) 
where yt =at +btxt is type t’s output after an optimal choice of period 2 budget. 
Alternatively, the government could spend less than ¯x. If so, then in equilibrium 
both types will produce the same output. For, if not, the low type could pool with 
the high type by changing output, and would then increase its period 2 budget. I 
assume that for x1 <x¯, the high type produces efﬁciently and the low type matches 
it. As a result the government’s total payoff will be 
d[aH +bHx1 
 kc(x1)] +p(aH +bHx2) + (1 
 p)(aL+bLx2) 
 c(x2) 
(3) 
where x2 solves the second period ﬁrst order condition 
c0(x2) = pbH + (1 
 p)bL: 
(4) 
Optimizing over x1, observe that the government should treat the bureaucracy like 
a high type, since the low type will pool at the same output. Thus the optimal 
choice ˆx1 solves c0(xˆ1) = bH=k. 
Comparing the two alternatives, the net beneﬁt of choosing ¯x can be split into two 
components. There is a period 1 negative gain of 
d[bH(x¯ 
 xˆ1) 
 k(c(x¯) 
 c(xˆ1))]: 
(5) 
12 

========13========

This is negative, and decreasing (without bound) in k and d.8 On the other hand 
there is a period 2 gain from knowing the types, of 
p[bH(xH 
 x2) 
 (c(xH) 
 c(x2))] + (1 
 p)[bL(xL 
 x2) 
 (c(xL) 
 c(x2))] (6) 
This is positive and unrelated to d or k. Summing these gains, if d or k is high 
enough, then the government will strictly prefer to choose ˆx1 in period 1, enacting 
a budget cut which weakens its ability to distinguish an effective from an ineffec- 
tive department. 
Empirics: behaviour of the bureaucracy 
One implication of this theory is that governments’ budget allocations do not de- 
crease continuously as the cost of funds k increases. Instead, at ﬁrst the govern- 
ment prefers to keep funding steady, so as to learn about the bureaucracy; a further 
increase in k leads to a discontinuous drop in the budget when maintaining the ex- 
isting level can no longer be afforded. Another implication is that productivity 
decreases after budget cuts. However, both these predictions are already made 
by extant theories: budget cuts may harm bureaucratic morale (Hood and Wright, 
1982); budget-setters may use the status quo as a reference point (Wildavsky, 
1964); and so forth. A more speciﬁc implication of the model is that high- and 
low-productivity departments will be affected differently by budget cuts. High- 
productivity departments will produce no less output after a budget cut than in 
normal times. Low-productivity departments will produce less, since they will

Table 1: US Public Libraries Survey, descriptive statistics 
pool with high-productivity departments. 
To test this prediction, I examine data from the US Public Libraries Survey, cover- 
ing 9965 US public library systems9 over the time period 1993 to 2009. Libraries 
are a plausible case for the theory. First, they produce measurable outputs – books 
lent, total visits and inter-library loans serviced – which are recorded in the survey 
data. Second, the “bleeding stumps” tactic appears to be known in the sector: li- 
brary management textbooks mention it as a potential method of avoiding budget 
cuts (e.g. Wood and Young, 1988). Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for this 
dataset. 
The Public Libraries Surveys include budget data, and also data on various out- 
puts, including attendance, circulation, and total annual Public Service Hours 
(summed over all library branches). I use Public Service Hours (PSH) as the main 
measure of output, since these should be least affected by variation in consumer 
demand. 
To get an intuition for the empirics, consider Figure 2. Each ﬁgure plots logged

========15========

yearly PSH against logged yearly budget for a single library in the dataset. The 
straight line is the result of a regression using only those years when the library’s 
(nominal) budget increased. Triangles show years when the budget decreased. For 
Viking Library System Operations, Minnesota, the line is relatively steep: in the 
model’s terminology, this library could be a “high type”. Correspondingly, in 3 out 
of 4 years of budget cuts, attendance was higher than the regression predicts. For 
Ypsilanti District Library, Michigan, by contrast, the line is not merely shallow 
but negatively sloped: the library achieved fewer Public Service Hours when its 
budget was larger. This is a “low type”. In 3 out of 4 years when its budget was cut, 
the Ypsilanti library performed worse than the prediction from the regression. As 
the model predicts, the less productive library underperformed when the budget 
was cut; the more productive library did not. 
To repeat this analysis for the entire dataset,10 I ran the following procedure for 
each library: 
1. Regress log PSH on log income, using only years in which income in- 
creased. 
2. Examine the difference between real PSH and PSH predicted from this re- 
gression (i.e. the residuals), for all “cutback years” in which income de- 
creased. 
3. Record the slope of PSH on income, and the proportion of residuals which 
were negative. 
10I used every library with at least 12 years of data during which the budget increased, and at least one year during which the budget decreased.

My hypothesis is that in cutback years, low marginal productivity libraries will 
be more likely to have lower-than-predicted public service hours, where marginal 
productivity is measured by the slope of PSH on library income. 
Figure 3 plots marginal productivity (i.e. the slope of the PSH-income regression) 
against the proportion of cutback years in which actual hours were fewer than 
predicted (ie of cutback years with negative residuals). As predicted, the more 
productive libraries, with the higher slopes, had fewer negative residuals in years 
of budget decrease (Kendall’s test of correlation: p < 0:001). Figure 4 shows 
the same data aggregated by deciles of productivity. The size of the effect is 
quite substantial: the least productive libraries underperformed in around 60% of 
cutback years, while the most productive libraries underperformed in around 40% 
of cutback years. 
As a robustness check I repeated the analysis using a quadratic in log income, 
measuring the PSH-income slope at the mean of the library’s log income. Re- 
sults were substantively unchanged (Kendall’s test: p < 0:001). I also reran the 
analysis using all libraries with at least 6 years when the budget increased, and 
again results were robust (Kendall’s test: p < 0:001). Lastly I repeated the basic 
analysis on subsets of the data. The relationship between productivity and under- 
performance during cutbacks was negative in 39 out of the 47 states for which 
enough measurements were available. It also held in every decile of library size, 
as measured by total income in 2000, was signiﬁcant at p < 0:05 (Kendall’s test) 
in 9 out of 10 deciles, and was always signiﬁcant at p < 0:10.

Empirics: behaviour of the budget-setter 
A further prediction of the model focuses on the government’s behaviour. In nor- 
mal times, the department’s ﬁrst period output informs the government of the de- 
partment’s type, and the government allocates a larger budget to more productive 
departments. After cutbacks, however, ﬁrst period output is no longer informative 
and the government ignores it in setting the second period budget. Thus, cutbacks 
reduce allocational efﬁciency in the longer term. 
The US libraries in the PLS dataset receive on average about 77% of their income 
from local governments, with about 10% coming from state governments. I ex- 
amine how budget change, the percentage change in a library’s income over years 
t and t 
 1, is affected by its short-run output elasticity in the previous two years, 
deﬁned as 
% change in total service hours; 
% change in budget 
over years t 
 1 and t 
 2. Elasticity will be high if the library increases total 
service hours in response to a budget increase, or if it decreases total service hours 
in response to a budget cut: in other words it is a short-run estimate of marginal 
productivity (in the model’s terms, of the library’s type). If governments indeed 
learn more from, and react more to, recent performance during normal years than 
cutback years, then the coefﬁcient of elasticity upon budget change will be larger 
during normal years. Table 2 shows the results. 
The ﬁrst column provides a basic check that budget-setters respond to a library’s 
short-run elasticity. A one standard deviation increase in elasticity (by 0.46) is

associated with an approximately one-and-a-third standard deviations change to 
the budget increment. Columns 2-3 include a dummy variable for a cutback year 
int 
 1, and interact this with elasticity measure. After cutback years, the effect of 
elasticity is signiﬁcantly less than after a normal year, as predicted by the theory; 
indeed, it is signiﬁcantly negative, so that when an initial cut has a large effect 
on output, then there is a smaller subsequent budget increase on average. The 
third column adds state and year ﬁxed effects.11 Columns 4-6 repeat the analysis, 
but use percentage change in local government funding as the dependent variable, 
with broadly similar results.12 
Extension: monitoring the bureaucracy 
When the cost of funds are high enough to rule out temporary spending increases, 
governments may seek alternative ways to control the bureaucracy. To see this, 
suppose that by paying a monitoring cost m, the government can ensure that the 
bureaucracy produces at its efﬁcient level y = at +btx in period 1. For instance, 
certain budget items may be ring-fenced, harming the bureaucracy’s ﬂexibility 
in responding to changing circumstances but simultaneously forcing it to cut the 
fat, not the muscle. Or, ex post checks may be used to discover and sanction 
inefﬁcient spending patterns. This will be unnecessary when x1  x¯, but will be 
worthwhile for high enough k. For, when both types produce efﬁciently, there are 
two beneﬁts – ﬁrst a period one beneﬁt, reﬂecting the extra productivity of a low 
11Other speciﬁcations were tried, including per-state time trends, and adding lagged budget change directly as a control. Coefﬁcients on elasticity and elasticity  cutback t  1 remained highly signiﬁcant in the expected direction. Results are available on request. 
12The “cutback in 
t  1” dummy is still deﬁned with reference to total funding, since this is what determines the ability of low-type bureaucracies to pool.

type bureaucracy that is prevented from pooling; second, the indirect beneﬁt from 
learning the types and allocating resources efﬁciently in period two. 
Speciﬁcally, after paying the monitoring cost, the government can choose x1 =x1. 
Each type of bureaucracy then produces efﬁciently in round 1, and the government 
can then correctly distinguish the type it faces, resulting in round 2 allocations of 
xH or xL. On the other hand, without monitoring, the government’s payoff is given 
by (3) with x1 set to ˆx1. If the monitoring cost is not too high, and if the credit 
crisis is sufﬁciently serious (k is high), then the government will always prefer to 
monitor.13 
Conclusion 
To enhance our understanding of the dilemmas of spending cuts, this paper de- 
veloped a simple theory in which government is uncertain about the effect of 
changing a department’s budget. The theory predicts that less efﬁcient depart- 
ments will be more affected by budget cuts, since they “pool” with more efﬁcient 
departments so as to exaggerate the effect of their loss. This prediction was con- 
ﬁrmed in a sample of US libraries. It was also conﬁrmed that budget-setters are 
less reactive to short-run estimates of the budget-output slope in the year after a 
budget cut. These results are compatible with the claim that budget cuts harm both 
short-run productive efﬁciency, and long-run allocative efﬁciency. 
It is worth reiterating this theory’s domain of application. The argument applies 
to bureaucracies whose output is measurable in the short term – so, for example, 
probably not to arts organizations, whose output is not easily measurable, nor to 
13Proved in the Appendix.

long-term infrastructure projects or investments whose impact is not immediately 
visible. Also, the assumption of a budget-maximizing bureaucracy implies that 
bureaucratic rewards cannot be directly linked to performance; in other words, 
contracts are incomplete. Incomplete contracts are a common theme in political 
economy. Nevertheless, governments in many developed countries have invested 
heavily in measuring and rewarding bureaucratic performance, and where this is 
successful, the information problem will no longer bite. Conversely, the Washing- 
ton Monument ploy need not be limited to politics; the same behaviour may arise 
within ﬁrms. It would be interesting to ﬁnd examples. 
The practical implication of this paper is straightforward: reforms and cuts do not 
mix, because cuts exacerbate the informational problems between government 
and the bureacracy. There may, nevertheless, be other ways in which spending 
crunches ease the path of public service reform. For example, they may increase 
electoral support for tough austerity measures. In the coming few years, as West- 
ern governments’ spending cuts take effect, there should be many opportunities 
for further research in this area.

to c0(x) = bH=k. Observe that ¯x1 < x1Then for k, (5) is

Proof that when m is not too high and k is sufﬁciently high, the government 
will prefer to monitor 
Speciﬁcally, the condition is m < (1 
off after paying to monitor is: 
 m+d[p(aH+bHx1)+(1 
 p)(aL+bLx1) 
 p)(aL 
 aH). The government’s total pay- 
 kc(x1)]+p(yH 
 c(xH))+(1 
 p)(yL 
 c(xL)): 
(7) 
Comparing (3) to (7) shows the government prefers to monitor if 
m < B1+B2; 
where B1 represents the period 1 beneﬁt of monitoring and B2 the period 2 beneﬁt: 
B1 
= d[p(aH +bHx1) + (1 
B2 
= p(bH(xH 
 x2) 
 [c(xH) 
 p)(aL+bLx1) 
 (aH +bHxˆ1) 
 c(x2)]) + (1 
 p)(bL(xL 
 x2) 
 k[c(x1) 
 c(xˆ1)]]; 
 [c(xL) 
 c(x2)]): 
B2 is easily seen to be positive since xH and xL are optimal for a high and low type 
respectively. B1 can be split into two components. First there is the value from 
preventing pooling, thus increasing the productivity of the low type. Second there 
26 

========27========

is the beneﬁt of being able to choose an ex ante optimal budget. Thus 
B1 
= d[p(aH +bHx1) + (1 
 p)(aL+bLx1) 
 kc(x1) 
f p(aH +bHxˆ1) + (1 
 p)(aL+bLxˆ1) 
 kc(xˆ1)g 
+fp(aH +bHxˆ1) + (1 
 p)(aL+bLxˆ1) 
 kc(xˆ1)g 
 (aH +bHxˆ1 
 kc(xˆ1)] 
The ﬁrst two lines are the beneﬁt of choosing an optimalx1. They sum to a positive 
amount since x1 is the optimal choice when types are unknown, and therefore 
maximizes p(aH +bHx) + (1 
 p)(aL+bLx) 
 kc(x). 
The last two lines are the beneﬁt of preventing pooling. They simplify to 
(1 
 p)(aL 
 aH + (bL 
 bH)xˆ1) 
Now, as k grows large ˆx1 ! 0 and this term approaches (1 
 p)(aL 
 aH). Thus if 
m < (1 
 p)(aL 
 aH), for k large enough the government will ﬁnd it worthwhile 
to monitor.
