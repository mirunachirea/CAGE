Scale Economies in Nonproﬁt Provision, 
Technology Adoption and Entry 
Kimberley Scharf§ University of Warwick and CEPR 
June 2011 
ABSTRACT 
We study competition between nonproﬁt providers that supply a col- lective service through increasing-returns-to-scale technologies under con- ditions of free entry. When providers adopt a not-for-proﬁt mission, the absence of a residual claimant can impede entry, protecting the position of an inefﬁcient incumbent. Moreover, when providers supply goods that are at least partly public in nature, they may be unable to sustain the adoption of more efﬁcient technologies that feature ﬁxed costs, because buyers (private donors) face individual incentives to divert donations to- wards charities that adopt inferior, lower-ﬁxed-cost technologies. These incentives may give rise to a technological race to the bottom, where non- proﬁt providers forgo opportunities to exploit scale economies. In these situations, government grants in support of core costs can have a non- neutral effect on entry, technology adoption, and industry performance.

1 Introduction 
We observe considerable variation in the composition of the funding sources of dif- 
ferent charities: for some, the bulk of funding is represented by government grants, 
whereas for others, government grants are a relatively minor component of funding; 
and there is considerable variation in cost structures across charities and charitable 
sectors, which is likely to reﬂect variation in technologies. There also appears to 
be some correlation between funding and cost structures: focusing on Canadian 
charities’ revenues and costs across different sectors of activities, we ﬁnd evidence 
(presented in Section 5) of a positive correlation between ﬁxed costs and the level of 
government funding received by charities relative to the total funding received. 
It is plausible that large ﬁxed costs would make charities vulnerable to ﬂuctua- 
tions in the level of private funding, which might in turn induce them to actively 
seek government funding; but this does not imply that government should oblige. 
For-proﬁt ﬁrms also face ﬁxed costs and uncertain cash ﬂows, just as nonproﬁt ﬁrms 
do, but this does not justify public support even when there is a public interest in 
promoting competition and entry of the most efﬁcient ﬁrms; indeed, as ﬁrst pointed 
out by Baumol and Willig (1981), ﬁxed, non-sunk costs need not impede entry and 
efﬁcient selection of producers. The same principle could apply to nonproﬁt ﬁrms: 
provided that donors are fully informed about charities’ performance, unfettered 
competition between charities will allow those charities that deliver the highest 
value for donors to attract the most funding and to be best positioned to meet their 
ﬁxed costs and deal with a ﬂuctuating cash ﬂow; those charities that cannot handle 
their ﬁxed costs will then be (efﬁciently) selected out. Thus, although government 
support of charities may be warranted on the grounds that charities provide collec- 
tive goods and services, it is not obvious that it should be warranted speciﬁcally on 
the basis of core funding needs. 
In this paper we set out a pro-competitive based rationale for why government 
1 

========3========

funding of ﬁxed costs may be called for in the case of non-commercial, nonproﬁt 
providers, and conjecture that the observed positive correlation between govern- 
ment funding and charities’ ﬁxed costs may relate to the way that scale economies 
in provision affect entry and technology adoption incentives in the nonproﬁt sec- 
tor. We show that, unlike in the case of for-proﬁt ﬁrms, the presence of ﬁxed costs 
might impede competition between nonproﬁt providers and give rise to inefﬁcient 
selection. 
The combination of ﬁxed costs with a non-distribution constraint gives rise to 
two different types of competition failure. 
The ﬁrst relates to entry by new providers. In the presence of a non-distribution 
constraint, any surplus or shortfall experienced by a nonproﬁt provider is reﬂected 
in the level of its provision rather than in its residual proﬁt claims. This makes 
a switch by an individual donor towards a start-up charity unattractive even if 
this start-up is potentially more efﬁcient, because such a switch would result in 
lower rather than higher provision unless the switch is coordinated across donors. 
As a result, when private contributions are directed towards nonproﬁt providers 
that face ﬁxed costs, non-cooperative contributions equilibria – as characterized by 
Bergstrom, Blume and Varian (1986) – can support an inefﬁcient status quo. Thus, 
in the absence of a residual claimant, ﬁxed costs can translate into entry barriers. 
This contrasts with the case of for-proﬁt ﬁrms, where price competition in the pres- 
ence of a residual claimant makes uncoordinated deviations to lower cost providers 
worthwhile for individual consumers even if there are ﬁxed, non-sunk costs. 
The second source of failure relates to technology adoption by incumbents. When 
the services provided include a collective consumption component, individuals are 
able to beneﬁt from the provision of varieties they do not directly contribute to. This 
means that the link between the payments individuals make towards ﬁxed costs 
and the inframarginal gain they experience from being able to access the service 
provided is broken. As a result, individuals will face incentives to abandon those 
2 

========4========

charities that adopt technologies with ﬁxed costs in favour of other charities that 
adopt inferior, variable-cost-only technologies; this will in turn induce charities to 
forgo opportunities to exploit scale economies and adopt inferior technologies. 
Although these results follow quite naturally from the structure of the interaction 
between donors who face competing charities, to the best of our knowledge, they 
have not been identiﬁed before in the literature. 
Our analysis and conclusions are consistent with the prominence given by char- 
ities to core funding “strategies”. Charities often lament that donors are typically 
unwilling to fund core costs – making it difﬁcult for start-up charities to get off the 
ground and for more established charities to cover management and general admin- 
istration costs – and consistently lobby government to step in with grants to cover their ﬁxed operating costs.1 Government funding choices do appear to be sensitive 
to charities’ core funding needs, but what is not clear is whether this is motivated by 
the need to promote entry by new charities – overcoming the implicit entry barriers 
that ﬁxed costs induce in the presence of a non-distribution constraint – or by the 
need to support efﬁcient technology adoption by incumbents. Focusing on infor- 
mation from a comprehensive panel of Canadian charities to look at this question, 
we ﬁnd no evidence of more core government funding being directed to support 
the start-up costs of new entrants. On the contrary, it is the older, more established, 
charities that receive comparatively larger grants (relative to their size). 
Our paper contributes to the debate on conduct and performance in the nonproﬁt 
sector vis-a-vis the for-proﬁt sector. This has focused mainly on the implications of` 
organizational form for internal performance along various dimensions – informa- 
tion and agency costs (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972; Hansmann, 1980; Easley and 
1 
The difﬁculties that charities face in persuading donors (especially small ones) to make dona- tions that are not earmarked towards project costs and can be used to fund core costs leads charities to formulate speciﬁc core funding strategies. See, for example, Scott (2003) and Institute for Philan- thropy (2009).

O’Hara, 1983; Glaeser and Schleifer, 2001), differential regulatory and tax regimes 
(Lakdawalla and Philipson, 2006), access to pro-socially motivated workforce (Gha- 
tak and Mueller, 2009). The implications of organizational form for inter-charity 
competition and industry structure have received less attention. A recent exception 
is Philipson and Posner (2009), who study – as we do here – competition between 
providers that pursue nonproﬁt objectives. Their focus, however, is different from 
ours, as they consider markets that are not contestable, i.e. where there are barriers 
to entry, concluding that, as in the case of for-proﬁt ﬁrms, antitrust regulation may 
be called for. Their arguments hinge on the incentives that nonproﬁt ﬁrms have to 
defend their incumbency position even when it is not socially efﬁcient to do so. The 
sources of inefﬁciency we identify here stems instead from the relationship between 
private donors’ decisions on the one hand and entry and technology adoption de- 
cisions on the other in the presence of ﬁxed costs. While antitrust measures are not 
well suited to tackle the kinds of failure we identify here, public support of core 
funding needs may be able to alleviate it. 
Two other recent studies that are related to ours are Pestieau and Sato (2006) and 
Ghatak and Mueller (2009). The former points out that scale economies (or equiv- 
alently ﬁxed costs) in provision must be posited in order to rationalize the exis- 
tence of charities that channel contributions from multiple donors having heteroge- 
neous preferences for alternative varieties of collective goods. Our characterization 
of the relationship between ﬁxed costs and industry structure is quite different from theirs, but can be viewed as complementary to it.2 Ghatak and Mueller (2009) show 
2 
Our conclusions would carry over to a scenario where there are ﬁxed costs and where the ser- vices provided by different charities are viewed by donors as being different goods. An equilibrium outcome would then feature multiple charities; but, as in the homogeneous good case – and unlike in an analogous scenario with heterogeneous goods and for-proﬁt ﬁrms – the presence of ﬁxed costs would imply that the resulting selection of charities would not necessarily correspond to a socially efﬁcient selection.

how a for-proﬁt manager, acting as residual claimant, may be comparatively better 
positioned to engage pro-socially motivated workers in incentive contracts. This 
somewhat parallels our conclusion that, in the presence of ﬁxed costs, the residual- 
claimant position of for-proﬁt start-ups can make it comparatively easier for them 
to divert contributions away from incumbents. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes our basic mod- 
elling setup. Section 3 looks at provision outcomes under monopoly. Section 4 fo- 
cuses on entry. Section 5 discusses some evidence on the relationship between ﬁxed 
costs and government funding for the Canadian case. Section 6 concludes. 
2 Setup 
2.1 Preferences and technologies 
There are h identical individuals, denoted by i 2 H  f 1, . . . ,hg each endowed with 
some exogenous income y – which, without loss of generality we shall be assume 
to be equal to unity – and consuming a service provided by nonproﬁt suppliers – 
a service that can be private and/or collective in nature – as well as purely private 
consumption. Assume Cobb-Douglas preferences of the form 
U(gi,zi) = q ln gi + (1 
 q)lnzi, 0  q  1, (1) 
where gi and zi are respectively individual i’s effective consumption of the service 
in question and other private consumption. In turn, effective consumption of the service, gi, may result from a combination of private and collective consumption beneﬁts. Speciﬁcally, if xi is the amount of the service “purchased” by i, and x 
 i 
is 
the amount purchased by others, consumption beneﬁts for i are 
gi = j(xi + gx 
 i), 
g 2 [0, 1]. (2)

where x 
i 
 j=i xj and g > 0 measures the extent to which the service is collective in nature,3 and f is a scale parameter. If we impose j = 1/(1 + (h

is the average purchase by all individuals other than i. This speciﬁcation inten- 
tionally abstracts from scale economies in provision arising from group size – for xi = x,i 2 H, changes in g have no effect on gi – with the parameter s combin- 
ing the extent of individual spillovers with group size to determine the degree of 
“publicness” of provision. 
Provision of the service by some provider j can take place through a technology 
that features a ﬁxed cost, Fj, and a constant marginal cost, cj. 
Further, we shall assume that, absent a proﬁt objective, providers aim at maxi- 
mizing their own output.4 
Assuming provision is carried out by provider j, in a symmetric outcome where xi = x for all consumers and where the ﬁxed costs of provision are allocated equally across individuals, we have g = x and zi = 1 
 Fj/h 
 cjg. The socially efﬁcient 
level of provision is then identiﬁed by the condition

A fully equivalent interpretation of this mixed private/public beneﬁt formulation is that the pri- vate component reﬂects an individual’s “warm glow” from contributing to collective consumption. 
4 
This can be rationalized by simply assuming that providers value provision of the service more than consumers and are biased towards own provision, i.e. they value their own provision more than they value provision by other suppliers. For a general discussion of nonproﬁts’ objectives and 
conduct, see Brown and Slivinski (2006).

2.2 Information and the not-for-proﬁt constraint 
Service providers are nonproﬁt entities that face a non-distribution constraint, i.e. their proﬁts must be zero.5 This constraint can be viewed as an endogenous re- 
sponse to the presence of output veriﬁcation constraints – an idea that has been 
discussed extensively in the literature going back to Hansmann (1980). That is, if 
service delivery is not veriﬁable in contractual arrangements, providers facing a 
zero proﬁt constraint would outperform for proﬁt providers, and consequently the 
nonproﬁt organizational form would be selected.6 
Individuals can fully observe providers’ technologies. Providers have full infor- 
mation about individuals’ preferences as well as other providers’ technologies. 
3 Monopoly provider 
We ﬁrst focus on the case where the service is provided by a single supplier enjoying 
a monopoly position (i.e. not facing any potential challenger) producing the service through a technology with a cost structure (c,F). The question of how ﬁxed costs 
5 
In a dynamic framework, short-run proﬁts can be positive or negative even when a non- distribution constraint is present, but proﬁts must be zero in the long run. However, in this static, a-temporal framework, a non-distribution constraint translates directly into a zero-proﬁt constraint. 
6 
With collective consumption, overall output may be difﬁcult to verify even when deliveries to individual purchasers are fully veriﬁable, which makes veriﬁcation problem comparatively more likely to occur in the case of collective goods, as the following example illustrates. Suppose that two individuals each contribute an overall amount v towards provision of a purely collective service with marginal cost c = 1; even if each contributor is able to verify that an amount v is provided as a direct consequence of her own individual contribution, she may be unable to verify that an additional amount v is also provided as a result of the other individual’s contribution. In this case, the provider may be able to supply a total amount v (rather than an amount 2v) and still satisfy its contractual obligations with each of the two contributors.

relate to entry by potential challengers is examined in the next section. 
Given that what is provided is a service rather than a good, there are no re-sale 
opportunities that could limit the use of two-part pricing. The provider can thus 
charge a two-part tariff – a combination of an access fee, t, and a price, p, per unit provided.7 Buyers will then choose whether or not to access the service on offer, 
incurring an access fee of t, and how much of the service to purchase if they do. 
The non-distribution constraint for the provider is ht + pX 
 F 
 X = 0, where 
X is the total amount provided. If p is to be taken by customers as a marginal price 
– on the basis of which they formulate their demand choices – the above constraint must be satisﬁed for any possible value of X, not just in equilibrium.8 This means that, if n individuals choose to access the service, then (t = F/n, p = c) is the only 
feasible pricing choice for a supplier. So, for an individual who chooses to access the 
service, the amount payable towards coverage of ﬁxed costs depends on the number 
of individuals accessing the service. 
An individual’s access decision will involve weighing the access fee t against the 
total surplus received at the marginal price p = c. 
For the assumed speciﬁcation of preferences, the individually optimal level of 
service purchase for an individual facing price c, if she chooses to pay t to directly 
access the service, is the level for which 
(1  s)MRS(gi, 1  t  cxi) = 
q 1  t  cxi 
1  q gi 
= c. (6) 
With s = 0 – the private good case – we have gi = xi. Given the assumed pref- erences, gi is an essential good, i.e. limgi!0 U(gi,z0) < U(g00,z00) for any possible 
7 
We focus on anonymous (nondiscriminatory) pricing schemes that offer identical terms to all individuals (who are identical). 
8 
Suppose that the constraint were to hold only in equilibrium, i.e. that it would be violated if the customers were to demand one more unit of output above the equilibrium level. Since the supplier is bound by a zero-proﬁt constraint, it would not be able to supply the extra unit at the stated conditions, implying that p could not be taken as a marginal price by customers. 
8 

========10========

combination of values z0 > 0, g00 > 0,z00 > 0. This implies that the individual will 
always choose to access the service for any level of t. In the private good case, the 
level of service provided to others has no effect on the access decision by an indi- 
vidual. On the other hand, because of the non-distribution constraint the provider 
faces, the proportion of other individuals accessing the service will affect the access fee, t = F/n; but since all individuals will always choose to access the service, n 
always equals h, and thus t equals F/h. 
If s > 0, i.e. the service is not purely private in nature, individual access deci- 
sions, as well as the quantity of the service purchased after gaining direct access to provision, depend on the level of service provision to others. If n  h individuals purchase the service, the pricing scheme is (t = F/n, p = c). If n individuals access 
the service, all n participating individuals will purchase the same amount xi = x.9 
Thus, we will have x¯

n and equal to unity for h = n); then we can write g = q(s,n)x, implying x = 
g/q(s,n). Condition (6) then becomes

This is decreasing in s (reﬂecting progressively increasing free riding in individual

On the other hand, starting from the same situation, if one of the h 
 n individ- 
uals not participating in provision, say individual i, chooses to participate, while 
all other n individuals that are already participating keep their purchases at x = gˆ(s,n)/q(s,n), she will experience a payoff equal to maxxi U (1  s)x

It can be shown that if there exists an equilibrium where n individuals always 
choose to participate, it will feature h = n. 
Result 1 If there exists a pure-strategy equilibrium where some individuals always partici- 
pate in provision, it will involve all individuals participating. 
PROOF: For a pure strategy equilibrium with n < h participating individuals to exist, we must have Wˆ (s,n)  0 and Yˆ (s,n)  0, which in turn requires U 
 
gˆ(s,n), 1  F/n  
11 
As already discussed, this means that the total ﬁxed costs, F, will now be shared amongst the remaining n  1 individuals. An alternative assumption that could be made regarding out-of- equilibrium conjectures is that the total payment (including the access fee) remains constant for non- deviators and provision falls in order to offset the loss in total access fees. This would imply that the spillover experienced by a deviator would be reduced by a further amount F/(h(h  1)). This expression is decreasing inversely with the square of h, making the difference negligible for h large.

condition Yˆ (s,n)  0 becomes irrelevant. 
 
For such an equilibrium to exist, we must have W(s)  Wˆ (s,h)  0. Next, we 
establish that, for small enough spillovers, this will be the case. 
Result 2 A pure-strategy, symmetric equilibrium where all individuals choose to pay the 
access fee to access provision will exist for s lying within an interval [0,s˜]. 
PROOF: In order to derive the relevant conditions for W(s)  Wˆ (s,h)  0 to be satisﬁed, 
 ¥ and lims!1 W(s) = 
 (1 
 
we can reason as follows. We note ﬁrst that lims!0 W(s) = 
 F/n) > 0; and so, by continuity, there must be at least one value s˜ for which 
q)ln(1 
W(s) = 0. We can also note that the second term of W(s,h), as deﬁned in (9), is increasing in 
s (decreasing in absolute value). The ﬁrst term is increasing in sg(s), where g(s)  gˆ(s,h). 
In turn the expression sg(s) can be increasing or decreasing in s, but its ﬁrst derivative with 
respect to s is monotonically decreasing – the second derivative of sg(s) with respect to s 
is 
 
2(1  q)q (1 
c(1  qs)3 
 F/h) 
< 0. (11) 
We can then conclude that there there will exist a single s˜ such that W(s˜) = 0, and such that 
W(s) < 0 for s < s˜ and W(s) > 0 for s > s˜. An equilibrium with access by all individuals 
will then exist for s 2 [0,s˜]. 
 
For s > s˜, the only symmetric equilibrium will be in mixed strategies, and will 
be identiﬁed by a condition stating that the expected payoff from choosing direct ac- 
11 

========13========

cess equals the expected payoff from not doing so.12 For the purpose of our analysis, 
we will restrict our attention to the case where an equilibrium in pure strategies ex- 
ists – although our arguments could be readily extended to the mixed-strategy case. 
Spillovers in provision imply that provision choices will be suboptimal. In the 
presence of ﬁxed costs and entry fees, there are two separate margins of choice to 
consider, the extensive margin (whether or not to pay the access fee to gain direct 
access to service provision) and the intensive margin (how much of the service to 
purchase at marginal cost). With respect to the latter, inspecting expression (7), one can verify that a Pigouvian correction – a subsidy on price at a rate s = s/(1  s) that reduces the price faced by individuals to c/(1 + s) = (1  s)c – can internalize 
externalities in marginal provision choices (choices on the intensive margin): if in- dividuals face a subsidized price p0 = p/(1 + s) = (1  s)p, the level of provision coincides with the private provision level as identiﬁed by (6) with s = 0. However, 
such a subsidy cannot correct for the effect of the externality on choices made on the 
extensive margin. This is because free riding incentives with respect to access fees 
relate to a discrete decision rather than a marginal choice. What this implies is that 
subsidization of entry fees (or, equivalently, ﬁxed costs) at the standard Pigouvian rate of s/(1  s) is unable to force full internalization. 
Result 3 Under monopoly provision, and in the presence of ﬁxed costs, public subsidization

Letting p denote the probability with which each individuals chooses to access the service di- rectly, a mixed strategy equilibrium will then satisfy the indifference condition

 F/h  cxi), and x¯ 
 i 
= (h0  1)/(h  1)xi, with h0 2 (0, . . . ,h) denoting a particular realization of mixed strategies where h0 individuals access the service. As h approaches inﬁnity, with probability approaching one the number of individuals accessing the service will be h0 = ph, provision will be gˆ(s,ph), and the indifference condition will approach the condition Wˆ (s,ph) = 0. Note that since the service is an essential good in individuals’ preferences, an equilibrium with p = 0 can never exist.

of all price components at a rate that reﬂects the marginal spillover from private provision 
cannot generally ensure a ﬁrst-best outcome. 
PROOF: Suppose that all purchases are subsidized at rate s, with the revenue requirement 
covered by a uniform lump-sum tax. Those making purchases then face a marginal price 
equal to (1 
 s)c and face a lump-sum tax equal to scg, making their private consumption 
equal to 1 
 F/h 
 cg – as in the private good case. A deviator who chooses not to participate 
still faces a lump-sum tax equal to scg and so her private consumption increases to 1 
 scg 
rather than to 1. The payoff change experienced by the deviator is then

inﬁnity; for s = 1, we can express Ws(1), substituting from (8) and (1), as

The derivative of Ws(s) with respect to s is 
q 1  s(1  F/h)

> 0. (15) 
Thus, there will be a range of values of s below s = 1 where deviation will be proﬁtable 
even in the presence of a Pigouvian subsidy, and where therefore an additional subsidy on 
access fees will be required. 
Subsidization of access fees at the same rate s = s/(1 
 s) may still be insufﬁcient to 
induce full internalization: proceeding as above, one can show that there will still be a range 
of values to the left of s = 1 where an even higher subsidy on access fees will be required.

4 Entry 
We come now to the heart of our analysis, i.e. the question of how ﬁxed costs in 
charity provision affect entry. As we shall see, ﬁxed costs result in two different 
kinds of “failures” with respect to entry decisions. The ﬁrst is a failure to enter: ﬁxed 
costs can keep out more efﬁcient challengers, protecting inefﬁcient incumbents. The 
second is a failure to repel entrants: ﬁxed costs can encourage entry by inefﬁcient 
challengers, undermining the position of a more efﬁcient incumbent. 
4.1 Unsuccessful challenges by more efﬁcient providers 
In the case of competition between for-proﬁt providers, ﬁxed costs that are not sunk 
do not translate into entry barriers for challengers. In contrast, in the case of non- 
proﬁt providers, the presence of ﬁxed costs can effectively act as a barrier to entry 
and protect the position of inefﬁcient incumbents. 
Consider a provider (the “incumbent”) supplying an amount g(s), where s > s˜, 
and suppose that the incumbent faces a challenger that has access to a technology 
involving the same marginal cost, c, as the incumbent but a lower marginal cost 
FE < F. Given that providers are output maximizers that value own provision, having a less efﬁcient technology would not induce the incumbent to accommodate 
entry by a challenger. 
Starting from a situation where all individuals are making purchases from the 
incumbent, an individual who deviates from that choice and chooses to switch to the 
challenger would incur an entry fee equal to the full amount, FE, of the challenger’s ﬁxed costs, and would choose a level of purchase satisfying the condition 
(1 
 s)MRS(g˜i, 1 
 FE 
 cxi) = c, (16) 
with g˜i = (1 
 s)xi + sg(s), and experience a payoff change equal to 
U(g˜i, 1 
 FE 
 cxi) 
 U 
 
g(s), 1 
 F/h 
 cg(s). (17) 
14 

========16========

If FE is sufﬁciently large, then deviation is not proﬁtable despite the fact that the challenger has lower ﬁxed costs. 
Result 4 In the presence of ﬁxed costs, a challenger with the same marginal cost as the 
incumbent, and lower ﬁxed costs FE < F, will be unable to contest the position of the incumbent if FE > F/h. 
PROOF: To show this, note that deviation is always unproﬁtable for FE – since the individual 
can purchase the service at the same marginal cost but has a lower disposable income – and it is always proﬁtable for FE = 0 – if the individual switches and chooses x˜i = g(s), she 
will experience the same gi but a higher zi (and she can further improve on this by re- 
optimizing). Since the deviation payoff is decreasing in FE, there exists a minimum value 
FE < F above which deviation is unproﬁtable. Note that, for FE = F/h, a deviator would 
have the same disposable income and face the same marginal price, and so would choose xi = gi(s), which would make the deviation payoff equal to U 
 
g(s), 1  F/h  cg(s). We 
can therefore conclude that FE = F/h for all value of s. Thus, when ﬁxed costs are large – FE > F/h – the monopoly position of the incumbent cannot be contested by a challenger 
even if this can provide services at a lower average cost, unless the challenger can bring about a coordinated switch by all donors.  
The difference between the nonproﬁt case and the for-proﬁt case is that coordi- 
nation between donors towards efﬁcient charities is more difﬁcult to achieve than 
coordination of consumers towards efﬁcient ﬁrms. In the case of for-proﬁt ﬁrms 
consumers can be “herded” effectively through price competition: a for-proﬁt chal- 
lenger can undercut the incumbent and induce all consumers to switch, and it can 
do so credibly because consumers need not concern themselves about whether the 
challenger will succeed in meeting its objectives – i.e. the challenger is a residual 
claimant. This is not the case for nonproﬁt charities: a nonproﬁt challenger facing a 
binding non-distribution constraint is unable to make a corresponding binding offer 
15 

========17========

to all donors to provide the service at a lower average cost. If all individuals were 
to switch to the challenger, average costs would be lower, but individuals would 
only switch if they believed that others would do the same; as a result, no-one will 
switch. 
Thus, in the case of nonproﬁt providers the presence of ﬁxed costs may give 
rise to entry barriers and result in inefﬁcient selection even when technologies are 
such that markets would be fully contestable and efﬁcient in an analogous for-proﬁt 
scenario. It should be stressed that this conclusion hinges on the non-distribution 
constraint faced by nonproﬁt providers, and not on whether or not the service is col- 
lective in nature (the value FE is independent of s) – although the collective nature of the service may be ultimately responsible for the adoption of a nonproﬁt form, 
because of the more stringent veriﬁcation requirements that can affect the provision 
of collective goods. 
4.2 Successful challenges by less efﬁcient providers 
Now consider again an incumbent supplying an amount g(s), where s > s˜, but 
suppose that the incumbent faces a challenger that has access to a technology (FE,cE) which involves no ﬁxed costs (FE = 0) and a higher marginal cost cE > c, and is overall less efﬁcient than the incumbent’s. Speciﬁcally, we will assume that the 
challenger’s technology is such that the payoff of individuals in a symmetric pure- 
strategy equilibrium where the challenger becomes a monopoly provider is less than 
the corresponding payoff under the incumbent: 
U 
 
g(cE,s), 1  cEg(cE,s) < U 
 
g(s), 1  F/h 
 cg(s). (18) 
Given that providers are output maximizers that value own provision, having a less 
efﬁcient technology would not discourage the challenger. 
Starting from a situation where all individuals are making purchases from the 
incumbent, an individual who deviates from that choice and switches to the chal- 
16 

========18========

lenger would incur no access fee, and would choose a level of purchase satisfying 
the condition 
(1 
 s)MRS(g˜i, 1 
 cExi) = cE, (19) 
with g˜i = (1 
 s)xi + sg(s), and experience a payoff change equal to 
U(g˜i, 1 
 cExi) 
 U 
 
g(s), 1 
 F/h 
 cg(s)  F(cE,s). (20) 
Result 5 A challenger with an inferior technology with no ﬁxed costs and a marginal cost 
cE 2 cE,cE, where cE > c, may be able to contest the position of a more efﬁcient incumbent 
facing ﬁxed costs F. 
PROOF: To compare the deviation payoff in this expression with the corresponding devia- 
tion payoff in W(s), we can reason as follows.13 
First, note that selecting xi = 0 and obtaining a payoff U(sg(s), 1) is always feasible 
for a deviator, but here the deviator has the option of supplementing sg(s) with a direct 
purchase at no ﬁxed fee and at a marginal cost of cE. Selecting xi = 0 while still having this 
option would be optimal if 
 
cE = (1 
 s)MRS sg(s), 1)  c¯E(s). (21) 
For c < cE < c¯E(s), a choice xi > 0 is optimal and yields a higher payoff than a choice xi = 0. We can then conclude that, for c < cE < c¯E(s), a deviator will do better by switching to the challenger than by abstaining from all purchases, i.e. F(cE,s) > W(s). 
Consider now a scenario with s = s˜, i.e. where W(s) = 0. In this scenario, for cE = 
c¯E(s˜), we have 
cE = (1 
 s)MRS ˜ 
 
s˜g(s˜), 1) = (1 
 s)MRS g(cE,s˜), 1 
˜ 
 
 cEg(cE,s˜), (22) 
13 
A similar line of argumentation could be used for cases where FE is not zero but is less than F. 
17 

========19========

from (19) and (21). Equality in the marginal rates of substitution implies equal ratios of g to z, i.e. This implies s˜g(s˜) = g(cE,s˜)/ 
 
1  cEg(cE,s˜) 
. Since 1 
 cEg(cE,s˜) < 1, this implies s˜g(s˜) > g(cE,s˜), which in turn implies U 
 
s˜g(s˜), 1 
 
> U 
 
g(cE,s˜), 1  c 
Eg(cE, 
s˜) 
 
. Given that W(s˜) = 0 – and thus U 
 
s˜g(s˜), 1 
 
= U 
 
g(s˜), 1  F/h  cg(s˜) – we can con- clude that U 
 
g(s˜), 1  F/h  cg(s˜) 
 
> U 
 
g(c ,s˜), 1  c 
E 
g(c 
E 
,s˜)E , i.e. (18) is satisﬁed with strict inequality. Since the difference between U 
 
g(s), 1  F/h  cg(s) 
 
and U 
 
g(cE,s), 1  cEg(cE,s) 
 
is monotonically increasing in cE, there will exist a non-empty interval (cE(s˜), c¯E(s˜)), where (18) is satisﬁed. And since, as noted above, for cE strictly less than c¯E(s˜), we have F(cE,s˜) > W(s˜) = 0, we can conclude that for cE in the interval (cE(s˜),c¯E(s˜)), condition (18) is satisﬁed and F(cE,s˜) > 0. 
Finally, for cE in the interior of (cE(s˜),c¯E(s˜)), the expression F(cE,s˜) is strictly positive. The second derivative of F(cE,s) with respect to s is

qs 
 
h 
< 
cE 
 
0, (23) 
1  
F 
 
h 
 c 
 
+ c2 
which means that, for s > s˜, the expression F(cE,s) crosses zero at most once. By conti- 
nuity, we can then conclude that for any given cE 2 (cE(s˜),c¯E(s˜)), there exists a right-hand side neighbourhood of s˜ where W(s) < 0 and F(cE,s) > 0, i.e. where the presence of 
an inefﬁcient challenger will cause defection from a more efﬁcient incumbent who would 
otherwise supplied the service to all individuals. The symmetric equilibrium outcome will 
then be one where all individuals access provision from the challenger, with no-one facing 
individual incentives to switch back to the incumbent (if selecting to the challenger is pre- 
ferred to selecting the incumbent starting from a situation where all individuals access the 
incumbent – making the access fee equal to F/h – it will be even more so when there is a 
single individual accessing the incumbent for an access fee equal to F). 
 
It may be that the incumbent has ﬂexibility in its choice of technology; in this 
case, the presence of a less inefﬁcient challenger can induce the incumbent to switch 
to an inferior technology with no ﬁxed costs in order to protect its position. Suppose, 
for example, that beforehand (at some time zero) the incumbent can choose to adopt 
18 

========20========

the same technology as the challenger. Then, given that it places a premium on its 
own provision, it will do so rather than facing exclusion. The end result is the same. 
In either case, the presence of ﬁxed costs can bring about inefﬁcient entry and/or 
(equivalently) the adoption of inferior technologies by incumbents. 
4.3 Corrective policies 
As discussed in the previous section, government subsidization of ﬁxed costs can 
promote efﬁcient access decisions by service users. In the presence of competition 
between different providers, government subsidization of ﬁxed costs can also play 
a role in promoting efﬁcient selection of service providers. Funding of core costs of 
start-ups of charities is in line with the practice of government grants aimed at es- 
tablishing some “seed” funding. Established charities also routinely seek and obtain 
funding from government that is targeted to cover their “core” costs. According to 
our analysis, if ﬁxed costs of start-ups are fully or partially funded by government, 
entry by more by efﬁcient charities will be possible. If the ﬁxed costs of established 
charities are publicly funded, this will prevent competition from inducing inefﬁcient 
technology choices. In such situations, government funding of core costs would 
have intrinsically non-neutral effects on private provision: it will affect technology 
selection and thus “real” provision rather than just its monetary value, and would 
therefore not simply “crowd out” private spending. 
Subsidization of access fees (or equivalently funding of charities’ ﬁxed costs) will 
generally dominate direct regulation as a way of promoting efﬁcient selection, as the 
latter would require the government to have full information on the technologies 
of individual providers; but it will still require an assessment of the comparative 
severity of the two kinds of failures related to competition and entry: if there is a 
presumption that start-ups can promote the adoption of more efﬁcient technologies 
and that funding of established charities would instead promote technological en- 
19 

========21========

trenchment and the adoption of unnecessarily high ﬁxed costs technologies, then 
government funding of core costs should be directed towards start-ups; if instead 
there is a presumption that start-ups are inefﬁcient, opportunistic challengers that 
can take advantage of the higher ﬁxed costs of established charities in order to divert 
private funds their way, making it difﬁcult for established charities to fully exploit 
opportunities for economies of scale in provision, then core funding of core costs 
should be directed towards established charities.14 
5 An example 
The above results can be illustrated by means of an example. Let h = 100, q = 1/10, 
F = 5, c = 1. An individual’s payoff in a symmetric outcome where all individuals 
make purchases from the incumbent, for varying values of s, is shown as the solid 
curve in Figure 1. The dotted curve in the same ﬁgure represents the deviation 
payoff for an individual who chooses to make no purchases. This crosses the solid line at s ’ 0.33. So, for s < 0.33, all individuals make purchases from the incumbent 
if the incumbent is a monopoly provider. 
Consider now a potential entrant with c = 1 and FE = 2/30. Since FE > F/h = 0.05, the potential entrant will be unable to challenge the position of the incumbent. 
However, if the government subsidizes the entrant’s ﬁxed costs at a rate equal to or 
greater than 25%, entry will be possible. 
Consider now an entrant with FE = 0 and cE = 2. The symmetric equilibrium 
14 
A potential problem with this approach is that funding of core costs may induce an output- maximizing monopoly provider to adopt comparatively inefﬁcient technologies that exhibit higher ﬁxed costs and lower marginal cost: provision depends inversely on marginal cost, and so it may be maximized by a comparatively less efﬁcient technology choice that involves higher ﬁxed costs; sub- sidization of ﬁxed costs may facilitate the adoption of such technology. In the absence of Pigouvian corrective, such a choice may serve to partially offset the effect of the externality on choices on the intensive margin, albeit at a direct cost in terms of productive efﬁciency.

payoff where all individuals buy from the entrant (not shown) lies everywhere be- 
low the payoff for a symmetric outcome where all individuals make purchases from 
the incumbent (the solid curve in Figure 1), so condition (18) is satisﬁed for all values 
of s. The deviation payoff for an individual who switches to the entrant is shown 
as the dashed curve in Figure 1. This crosses the curve representing the symmet- 
ric outcome payoff where all individuals make purchases from the incumbent (the solid curve) at s ’ 0.2. So, for s between 0.2 and 0.33, the entrant would be able to 
contest the position of the incumbent, even if the latter is a more efﬁcient provider. 
Suppose the incumbent also has access to an alternative technology with ﬁxed costs F0 = 3/2 and marginal cost c0 = 3/2. The corresponding symmetric out- 
come payoff and deviation payoff are shown in Figure 2. The symmetric outcome 
payoff lies everywhere below the corresponding payoff for the technology with F = 5,c = 1 (shown in Figure 1), so the alternative technology is comparatively inefﬁcient. However, for s 2 (0.2, 0.33) the entrant cannot challenge the position 
of the incumbent if the latter adopts the alternative technology. Accordingly, for s 2 (0.2, 0.33) an output maximizing incumbent would choose to adopt the less 
efﬁcient technology. 
Suppose next that the government grants a 25% subsidy on access fees, and that 
this is funded by a lump-sum tax on all individuals. This would reduce the access 
fee to 0.75 F/h, and would correspondingly reduce the payoff for individuals who 
deviate to the entrant; this payoff is shown as the dash/dotted curve in Figure 1. 
With this subsidy, the position of the incumbent is protected, and its incentives to 
adopt less efﬁcient technologies are removed.

6 Evidence from Canada 
If charities’ core funding needs are a key determinant of government grants, then, 
other things equal, we should observe a higher ratio of government to private fund- ing in those charitable sectors that have higher ﬁxed costs.15 Patterns of government 
funding across different charitable sectors seem to be consistent with this prediction. 
Focusing on evidence pertaining to Canadian charities, Figure 3 plots the aver- 
age ratio of ﬁxed costs to total costs, FC ratio, against the average ratio of govern- 
ment to total funding, GF ratio, for thirty different charitable sectors as deﬁned by 
the Canada Revenue Agency, averaged over the period 1997-2005. These were com- 
puted using information from annual returns for 48,346 distinct charities; evidence 
on non-proﬁts is comparatively scarce, and this data set is unique in that it provides 
systematic accounting information relating to charities’ revenues and costs across 
all charitable sectors. The ratio of ﬁxed costs to total costs is obtained as the ra- 
tio of “management and general administration expenses” to “total expenditures”; 
the ratio of government to total funding is obtained as the ratio of ”total revenue 
from government” to the sum of “total revenue from government”, “revenue from 
memberships”, “revenue from fund-raising”, and “total gifts”.16 
Figure 3 shows a clear (and statistically signiﬁcant) positive correlation between 
15 
Hansmann (1981) shows that government subsidies may be required for nonproﬁts that face high ﬁxed costs and provide excludable goods (the speciﬁc case examined is that of the performing arts) but for a reason very different from the one discussed here. Our argument also applies to the case of non-excludable public goods. 
16We focus on charities that report ﬁxed costs and government support ratios lying strictly within 
the interval (0, 1). Our sample also excludes non-religious charities; although these can obtain gov- 
ernment support to fund activities other than those relating to religious worship, most of their bud- 
get is represented by private donations (almost 99% on average). The vast majority of all Canadian 
charities are non-commercial in nature – in our sample, revenues from sales of goods and services 
average to less than three percent of total revenues.

ﬁxed costs and government support. In our interpretation, this correlation reﬂects 
a relationship ﬂowing from the structure of operating costs to government support 
– whether this is a result of active government policies or a government response 
to lobbying by charities. A contrasting interpretation of this positive correlation 
between ﬁxed costs and government support is that charities may adjust their cost 
structure in response to increased funding by government, i.e. a reverse direction 
of causation. However, results of panel-based Granger causality tests performed on 
the above sample of charities, run counter to this latter interpretation.17 
According to our analysis, government funding of ﬁxed costs may be warranted 
in order to correct failures relating to competition and entry, either to facilitate entry 
of new charities or to support incumbents that face competition by new charities. 
One way to discriminate between these two possible sources of correlation is to 
look at how funding correlates with the characteristics of the charities that receive 
comparatively more grants from government. In the data, we can identify those 
charities that have been active for only one period, and thus construct a time-variant 
17 
Using the full panel of charities over the 1997-2005 period, we compared the following two dynamic panel speciﬁcations: (a) FC ratioi,t = a1FC ratioi,t 
 1 
+ b0GF ratioi,t + hi + ui,t (contempora- neous independent variable); and (b) FC ratioi,t = a1FC ratioi,t 
 1 
+ b0GF ratioi,t + b1GF ratioi,t 
 1 
+ hi + ui,t (contemporaneous and lagged independent variable), with charities’ ﬁxed costs at time t as the dependent variable and government support ratios as the independent variable; and where the ui,t’s are IID error terms and the hi’s are charity ﬁxed effects that are assumed to be uncorrelated with the error terms. If adding the lagged independent variable signiﬁcantly improves the forecast, then we can say that x causes y in the Granger sense (see Holtz-Eakin et al. (1988) for a discussion of Granger causality methods with panel data). To test for this, we estimated both speciﬁcations using the Arellano-Bond GMM estimator (Arellano and Bond, 1991), and then performed a Wald test for the forecast improvement obtained from moving from (a) to (b) (i.e. adding the lagged variable). In both speciﬁcations, the contemporaneous effect of the independent variable is found to be positive The Wald test, however, gives a c2 statistic of 1.38 with a P-value of .24 – implying that the govern- ment support ratio does not appear to “Granger cause” the ﬁxed cost ratio. On the other hand, doing the same for the reverse direction of causation also gives a positive estimate for the contemporaneous effect of the ﬁxed cost ratio on the government support ratio and a Wald c2 statistic of 2.93 with a P-value of .09.

indicator, Old, of whether the charity has just started its activity in the current period 
– assigning a value of 0 to Oldit if the charity was ﬁrst active at t, and a value of 1 if it was already active at t  1. 
We then ran panel regressions, covering the period 1998-2005, relating charities’ 
funding structure to their age and cost structure: speciﬁcally we ran one speciﬁ- 
cation where the ratio of government to total funds, GF ratio, for each charity is 
regressed against the aforementioned charity age indicator, Old, including sectoral 
and regional ﬁxed effects; and one where the charity age indicator, Old, is further 
interacted with the ﬁxed cost ratio, FC ratio, (which is also included as a separate 
regressor). Results are shown in Table 1. In both speciﬁcations, the coefﬁcient for 
the age indicator is positive and signiﬁcant at the 1% level. The interaction with the 
ﬁxed cost ratio also exhibits a positive and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient.18 
Thus, at the charity level, there is no evidence of more government funding being 
directed to support the start-up costs of new entrants. On the contrary, it is the older 
charities that receive more government grants, and it is the old charities that have 
comparatively higher ﬁxed costs that get more funding. In light of our analysis, the 
observed patterns would be consistent with a need to protect more established char- 
ities that have comparatively larger ﬁxed costs from adverse competition, enabling 
them to exploit scale economies in provision in the face of competitive pressure from 
inefﬁcient entrants. Admittedly, the pattern of established charities receiving com- 
paratively more government funding may have other explanations that have little 
to do with optimal policy choices on the part of government – it may simply be that 
established charities are better at soliciting funding from government. This interpre- 
tation, however, would not explain why the effect should be stronger for charities 
that exhibit larger ﬁxed costs. Nevertheless, we can make no claim here that the ev- 
18 
The negative and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient on the ﬁxed cost ratio means that, for new charities, FC ratio is negatively correlated with GF ratio.

idence we present identiﬁes a competition-related intent in observed funding deci- 
sions. We just note that, if we were to interpret observed funding decisions as being 
optimal, we should conclude that, in these decisions, the need to shelter established 
charities from inefﬁcient challengers must be dominating the need to promote entry 
by more efﬁcient start-ups. 
7 Summary and conclusion 
Unlike in the case of for-proﬁt ﬁrms, the presence of ﬁxed costs may interfere with 
competition amongst non-commercial charities and give rise to inefﬁcient selection. 
This is because, in the absence of a residual claimant pursuing a proﬁt motive, un- 
28 

========30========

coordinated donor choices can protect the position of an inefﬁcient incumbent; and 
because inefﬁcient challengers can leverage on free-riding with respect to ﬁxed-cost 
related charges to divert private spending away from more efﬁcient incumbents. 
Government funding of ﬁxed costs can enable entry by more efﬁcient providers and 
protect more incumbents from inefﬁcient challengers. 
The debate on the effect of government funding on the private provision of pub- 
lic goods and services has so far largely ignored the effects of government funding 
on inter-charity competition and market structure in the third sector. Our analysis 
shows that, once entry and technology adoption decisions are accounted for, there 
is no longer a theoretical prior that government grants that are directed towards 
charities’ core funding needs should be neutral, i.e. that they should simply crowd 
out private donations. On the contrary, such grants are able to affect entry and/or 
charities’ technology choices – and hence provision efﬁciency. 
Our theoretical analysis has intentionally abstracted from a number of real-world 
complications that would need to be incorporated in any applied model of compe- 
tition and entry. In particular, services provided by competing charities are likely to 
be viewed by donors and users of the services as being imperfect substitutes – con- 
sistently with the observation that multiple charities co-exist within a sector, and 
in parallel with the structure of applied models of competition and entry in private 
goods markets. Finally, empirical identiﬁcation of the effects we have formalized 
above would require a fully speciﬁed model of entry and inter-charity competition 
as well as a richer data set than that which is currently available.19 
19 
It is well understood that in models of competition with heterogeneous ﬁrms, the relationship between competition and industry structure hinges on the model’s speciﬁc assumptions (Sutton, 1991). Thus, a fully developed empirical analysis of the relationship between ﬁxed costs and entry would necessitate a structural estimation approach – and data that can support it.
