Abstract 
This paper re-examines aggregate and disaggregate import and export demand functions  for the United States over the 1975q1-2010q1 period. This re-examination is warranted  because (1) income elasticities are too high to  be warranted by standard theories, and (2)  remain high even when it is assumed that supply factors are important. These findings  suggest that the standard models omit important factors. An empirical investigation  indicates that the rising importance of vertical specialization combined with changing  tariff rates and transportation costs explains some of results. Accounting for these factors  yields more plausible estimates of income elasticities.

1. Introduction  
This analysis is motivated by the recent widening and narrowing of the U.S. trade  
balance, illustrated in Figure 1, and three key stylized facts regarding U.S. trade flows.  
The first stylized fact is the persistence of the Houthakker-Magee results, namely that the  
income elasticity of U.S. imports exceeds that of exports. Over the past 30 years, the gap  
is at least 0.3 for total goods and services, regardless of the method of estimation. In  
Chinn (2005), the gap is as high as 0.65. Table 1 presents estimates obtained from OLS,  
dynamic OLS, single equation error correction estimates and the Johansen maximum  
likelihood procedures confirming that finding. Furthermore, there is little evidence that  
the asymmetry is disappearing.   
  The second stylized fact is that values  of the income elasticities are quite high,  
and rising. In Table 1, the income elasticities are as high as 2.2 for imports, and 1.9 for  
exports. In Figure 2, the income elasticities are shown for four subperiods over the last 32  
years into four equal sub-periods. The income  elasticities are generally rising. Notice that  
in Figure 3 there is no similar pattern for price elasticities. One outstanding feature of the  
estimates is that the import price elasticity is typically quite low.  
  These high income elasticities are diff icult to reconcile with the standard  
differentiated goods model (see Goldstein and Khan, 1985). From a forecasting  
standpoint, high income elasticities1  are not troubling; but – as  discussed below – from an  
economic perspective, they are perplexing. The third stylized fact is that the variability of  
trade flows is increasing over time. For instance, the behavior of trade flows during 1999-

 This phenomenon has been noted before (Rose, 1991).

2000 is difficult to explain using standard models. As illustrated in Figure 3, both series  
surge in this period.   
  In this paper, I re-examine the behavi or of export and import flows, motivating  
the analysis by referring to new theories of  trade behavior. These  include differentiated  
goods models such as those forwarded by Krugman (1991). Several papers have  
exploited the implications of these models in a cross-section context, with some success.  
In this paper, I adopt a different approach. Disaggregating the data, one finds that some of  
the odd behavior of goods exports and imports can be isolated to the peculiar behavior of  
capital and durable goods; since such goods are often used to manufacture other capital  
goods or consumer goods, it seems that growth  in such categories is “inflating” the  
volume of such trade flows. Disaggregation is not sufficient, however. Various papers  
have pointed out that the growth of trade in intermediate goods may be nonlinearly  
related to the decline in trade barriers  and the heightened  importance of capital  
expenditures during certain phases of the business cycle. More recently, Mann and Plück  
(2007) have argued that disaggregation along category line and trading partner helps in  
obtaining reasonable parameter estimates.  
  Once one includes the variables that shoul d matter for such vertical specialization,  
the parameter estimates become more plausible. That being said, the parameter estimates  
for the auxiliary variables are not always in  the expected direction or statistically  
significant, and the results cannot be construed as definitive.

2. The Standard Model and the Supply Side  
2.1 The model specification  
The empirical specification is motivated by the traditional, partial equilibrium view of  
trade flows. Goldstein and Khan (1985) provide a clear exposition of  this “imperfect  
substitutes” model. To set ideas consider the algebraic framework similar to that used by  
Rose (1991). Demand for imports in the US and the Rest-of-the-World (RoW) is given  
by:  
DfYPUS US US 
US 
im 
= 
1 
(,$im )      (1)  
DfYPRoW RoW RoW 
RoW 
im 
= 
1(, 
$im 
)      (2)  
where  P$imis the price of imports relative to the economy-wide price level. The supply of  
exports is given by:  
SfPZUS US 
US US 
ex 
=

( 
$ex 
,)       (3)  
SfPZRoW RoW 
RoW RoW 
ex 
= 
2( 
$ex 
,)      (4)  
Where  P$ex  is the price of exports re lative to the economy-wide price level.  Note that the  
price of imports into the US is equal to the price of foreign exports adjusted by the real  
exchange rate.  
PPEP P PQP$$$$US US 
RoW RoW US RoW 
im 
×=× × ⇒ =ex 
im ex 
   (5)  
where E  is the nominal exchange rate in US$ per unit of foreign currency, the real  
exchange rate is   
Q = 
EPRoW 
PUS 
3 

========5========

where P  represents the  aggregate  level of prices of dome stically produced goods and  
services. Z  is a supply shift variable, represen ting the productive capacity of the  
exportables sector.   
An analogous equation applies for imports  into the rest-of-the-world. Imposing  
the equilibrium conditions that supply equals demand, one can write out import and  
export equations (assuming log-linear functional forms, where lowercase letters denote  
log values of upper case):2 
im q y zUS RoWttt=+ + + +ββ β β ε01 2 3 2 
t 
   (6)  
ex q y zRoW USttt=+ + + +δδ δ δ ε01 2 3 1 
t 
   (7)  
Where β1  < 0,  β2  > 0,  β3  > 0 and  δ1  > 0,  δ2  > 0,   δ3  > 0.  
  Notice that exports are th e residual of production over domestic consumption of  
exportables; similarly imports are the residual of foreign production over foreign  
consumption of tradables. The difference between this specification and the standard is  
the inclusion of the exportables supply shift variable, z. In standard import and export  
regressions, this term is omitted, implicitly holding the export supply curve fixed; in  
other words, it constrains the relationship between domestic  consumption of exportables  
and production of exportables to be constant (see Helkie and Hooper, 1988 for an  
exception to this rule). A bout of consumption at home that reduces the supply available  
for exports would induce an apparent structural break in the equation (6) if the z  term is  
                                                 
   
2  As Marquez (1994) has pointed out, there are a number of problems with this  specification, in terms of assumptions regarding expenditure shares. A number of other  potentially important factors are also omitted, including other trend variables (e.g,  immigration as in Marquez (2002) or the rise  of services export s as in Mann (1999)).  
4 

========6========

omitted. Similarly, omission of the rest-of-world export suppy term from the import  
equation makes the estimated relationships  susceptible to structural breaks.   
  Note that the supply term here is exp licitly partial equilibrium in nature. Unlike  
the Krugman (1991) model, where balanced trade implies supply creates its own demand,  
no specific presumptions are made regarding the source of this supply effect.   
  The problem, of course, is obtaining good  proxies for these supply terms. In the  
some previous studies, a measure of the U.S. capital stock has been used. Obvious  
candidates, such as US industrial production for US exports, exhibits too much  
collinearity with rest-of-world GDP to identify the supply effect precisely. That is why  
this supply factor has typically been identified in panel cross section analyses (Bayoumi,  
2003; Gagnon, 2004).   
2.2 Data and Estimation  
  Data on real imports and exports an d components of real GDP (2005 chain  
weighted dollars) were obtained for the 1967q1-2010q1 period. Domestic economic  
activity is measured by U.S. GDP in 2005 chain weighted dollars. Foreign economic  
activity is measured by real Rest-of-World GDP, weighted by U.S. exports to major  
trading partners. The real exchange rate measure is the Federal Reserve Board’s broad  
trade weighted value of the dollar. This  index uses the CPI as the deflator.   
5 

========7========

  The supply variables are more difficult  to identify. For the United States, two  
candidate variables are used: (i) net private nonresidential capital, and (ii) manufacturing  
production.3  For the rest-of-the-world, I use import-weighted rest-of-world GDP.   
  The trade costs are proxied by two variable s: (i) the average tariff rate for major  
economies, and (ii) the relative price of oil.  (Additional details on a ll these variables are  
contained in Appendix 1.)  
Estimation is implemented on data over  the period of 1975q1-2010q1. This period  
spans three episodes of dollar appreciation and three episodes of dollar depreciation. It  
also spans a period of tremendous volatility in trade flows, from 2008q3-09q3; in order to  
maximize the span of data, I retain this data for the analysis. In addition, the variation in  
the series should aid in identifying the relationships (as long as there are no structural  
breaks associated with this the trade collapse).  
The broad measure of dollar is used, as opposed to the major currencies measure,  
which is unrepresentative of relative prices faced by the U.S. import competing sector in  
recent years. In principle, it would be better to use a unit labor deflated index (Chinn,  
2006). However, such an index is not available for a broad set of currencies; of which the  
Chinese yuan would be the most important.4  In addition, by using this Divisia exchange  
rate index (which weights growth rates  of exchange rates by trad e weights), I sidestep the  
                                                 
   
3  Admittedly, industrial production is in some 
 sense too “endogenous” a variable to  include in the regression. From a theoretical perspective, a more desirable measure is the  capital stock measures as a proxy of the supply capacity of exportables, as in Helkie and  Hooper (1988). The question is whether these variables are measured with too much  error. Certainly, this is an almost impossible task for the rest-of-the-world, especially to  the extent that one wants to capture the impact of the newly industrializing countries and  China.  
4 
 For an analysis of how different results ar e obtained using different  deflators, see Chinn  (2005). In that analysis, I examine the impact  of using alternatively CPI, PPI and unit  labor cost deflated real exchange rates on estimates of trade elasticities.  
6 

========8========

question of whether the impact  of Chinese relative prices  are fully captured. For more  
this issue, see Thomas and Marquez (2006).  
In terms of estimation, there are a variety of alternative approaches to estimating  
the long run relationships, include the Johansen maximum likelihood method, and single  
equation error correction regressions. The advantage of such approaches is that they  
provide information on short run dynamics. One of the disadvantages is that the estimates  
are extremely sensitive to the treatment of  trends, and the selection of lag length. 
5 
   
As a consequence, the cointegrating relationship is identified using dynamic OLS  
(Stock and Watson, 1993). Two leads and four lags of the right hand side variables are  
included. In a simple two variable cointegrating relationship, the estimated regression  
equation is:  
yx xutti=+ + +γγ 
∑ 
−4 
01 
i=+2 
ΓΔ 
ti t+ 
This approach presupposes that there is only one long run relationship. This requirement  
should not be problematic, as there is typically little evidence of more than one  
cointegrating vector for these four-variable systems.   
2.3 Empirical Results  
2.3.1 The Basic Specification 
First I consider equations (6) and (7) suppressing the z  terms. The long run export  
elasticities are reported in Table 2. The income elasticity for total exports of goods and  
services is 1.81 (Column [1]). This finding is not an artifact of the inclusion of services.  
In fact, the goods only elasticity is 1.87 (Column [3]). The high coefficients hold for  
                                                 
5 
  See Chinn (2005) for results using these approaches.

========9========

different aggregates including goods ex Agricultural goods. The services elasticities are  
slightly lower, at about 1.67.  
  A similar result obtains for imports. As  reported in Table 3, Column [1], total  
imports of goods and services also exhibit a long run elasticity of  2.19. However, in all  
instances, there appears to be substantial sensitivity to the inclusion of time trends,  
suggesting the omission of important variables. (Alternatively, a cointegrating  
relationship is absent between these specific trade aggregates and the included income  
and price variables.)  
  In addition to the empirical motivation fo r examining different aggregates, there is  
a standard convention to consider, for instance, an import aggregate excluding petroleum.  
The trade equations in (6) and (7) are derived from an imperfect substitutes model, well  
suited to manufactured goods. However, oil is  a natural resource co mmodity that does not  
quickly respond to market signals, and exhibits trends due to resource depletion. A  
similar argument might be used to motivate a focus on a non-agricultural goods export  
variable. Figures 5 and 6 depict these alternative series and break out services.  
  Interestingly, these remarkably high estimated income elasticity estimates persist,  
for both export goods ex.-Agriculture and import goods ex.-oil (columns [3] in Tables 2  
and 3). On the other hand, estimated price elasticities are  higher (in absolute value) for  
these disaggregate components. These findings suggest some aggregation bias.  
  These high estimated income elasticities  inform the debate over the durability of  
the Houthakker-Magee (1969) findings. Exports involving goods respond 1.8 to 1.9  
percent for each one percentage point increase in rest-of-world income. In contrast,  
imports rise about 2.3 to 2.6 percentage points for each percentage point increase in US  
8 

========10========

GDP. This set of findings suggests that the Houthakker-Magee income asymmetry  
persists. Hence, even if U.S. and foreign growth rates were to converge, net exports  
would continue to deteriorate even  starting from balanced trade.   
2.3.2 A Supply Augmented Specification 
All of the preceding specifications exclude a role for the supply side, suggested by  
Equations (6) and (7). In Table 4, the results for specifications incorporating the supply  
side are included, where the supply side  is proxied by manufacturing production. 
6 
 The  
income elasticity of demand falls from 1.8 to 0.9, with the supply coefficient equal to  
close to unity (Column [1]). Unfortunately, the results are sensitive to the inclusion of a  
time trend. Counter-intuitively, exports of goods ex Agriculture are not as easily modeled  
for this specification; the rest-of-world income is not statistically significant. Inclusion of  
a time trend leads to a negative coefficient estimate on real GDP.  
   On the import side, the inclusion of suppl y side effects is slightly less successful.  
In this case, the supply side variable is import-weighted real GDP. In Table 4, Column  
[5], the import income elasticity rises from 2.19 to 4.07, with the coefficient on foreign  
GDP taking on a negative value. Excluding oil from the import aggregate leads to slightly  
more sensible results, but the supply side variable is never significant.  
  Unfortunately, in all these instances,  the demand and supply variables are so  
collinear that the results are sensitive to the inclusion of the time trends.7  This is why  
                                                 
6 
  The regressions incorporating private nonr esidential capital stock are unsuccessful to  the extent that the coefficient on the supply variable exhibits the wrong sign.  
Interestingly, the two series exhibit similar trends, and according to certain tests, are  cointegrated.  
7  
 For a survey of research related to th e ongoing trade collapse and rebound, see Baldwin  (2009). Freund (2009) provides empirical evidence over time.  
9 

========11========

cross-section and panel regressions such as Gagnon (2003)  and Bayoumi (2003) obtain  
more supportive evidence of supply side effects.   
3. Vertical Specialization and Tariffs  
One hint of why the income elasticities are so large is provided by the surge in both  
exports and imports during 1999-2000. In informal discussions, this jump is associated  
with the investment boom; the category experiencing the largest jump is capital goods.  
The fact that the surge and collapse occurred in both categories could be coincidence –  
evidence of a synchronized worldwide investment boom. Or it could be a reflection that  
the two are interlinked.   
  Recent research has focused on the rise  of intermediate goods in international  
trade. However, intermediate goods are not in and of themselves sufficient to explain the  
rise in trade. It is intermediate goods trade used to produce other traded goods – in other  
words vertical specialization (Hummels, et al., 2001; Yi, 2003; Chen et al., 2005) – that is  
required. This process of importing in order to export has also  been termed the  
“fragmentation” of the production process (Arndt, 1997). At this juncture, it is useful to  
recognize that services exhibit less of this fragmentation.8  This explains in part the  
differential import income elasticities: 2.62 for goods ex oil versus 1.64 for services.9    
                                                 
8  
 Barrell and Dées (2005) and Camerero and  Tamarit (2003) address the issue of very  high income elasticities by incorporating FDI into the specifications. IMF (2007)  incorporates exports of intermediates in the import equation, and imports of intermediates  in the export equation, to account for vertical  specialization. This procedure reduces the  estimated income elasticities.   
9 
  Marquez (2005) obtains similar estimates,  but points out that further disaggregation of  services leads to different insights  on income and price elasticities.  
10 

========12========

  Figures 7 and 8 show how differently di fferent goods aggregates behave. Note  
that the series excluding capital goods exhibits much less of a pronounced hump. The  
importance of vertical specialization was suggested, particularly for hi-tech goods, in  
analyses around the time of the capital goods  surges (e.g., Council of Economic Advisers,  
2001, Chapter 4).   
The regression results in Column [1] of Table 5 repeat the results in Colum [3] of  
Table 4. Adding in the trade costs – tariffs and transportation costs – leads to  
substantially improved results. Foreign demand and home supply enter with roughly  
equal coefficients, while the price elasticity is fairly high, at 0.744. The tariff factor and  
the square both enter with statistical significance, indicating that lower tariffs increase  
trade flows. However, as expected higher energy costs, as proxied by the relative price of  
oil, also enters in. This result corroborates the findings  of Bergin and Glick (2006).  
Qualitatively, the results are the same when examining the goods ex.-agriculture, ex.- 
capital goods (column [3]), with the exception of a role for transport costs.   
  An alternative breakdown is between  durables and nondurables. Durables exports  
and imports are graphed in Figure 9, along with the tariff factor. Notice that as the tariff  
factor flattens out, the trend growth rate of durables growth slows down. The estimates  
for durables and nondurables aggregates on the export side are reported in columns [4]  
and [5], respectively. Durables  exhibit the posited relations hip, while nondurables are not  
apparently related to the supply variable, and transport costs.10  Finally, in line with  
expectations, the coefficient on foreign income  is the highest for the capital goods exports  
                                                 
10  
 In addition, the tariff factor coefficients  in the full specification exhibit the wrong  signs. I drop the level variable in the reported results.  
11 

========13========

category. In this case, a one percent increase in foreign income is associated with a 1.3  
percent increase in capital goods exports.  
  In general, it is more difficult to fit the import data. The results in Column [8]  
contrasts with the baseline results in Column [7], insofar as the income elasticities (for  
demand and supply) are much more plausible. The coefficients on tariffs and  
transportation costs enter with the correct sign, although the latter coefficient is not  
statistically significant. Qualitatively similar results obtain for imports of goods ex.-oil,  
ex.-capital goods.   
  Using the alternative breakdown, one finds  that the coefficients for the durables  
aggregate are correctly signed, although transportation costs are not significant. For  
nondurables, foreign supply, the exchange rate and transportation costs fail to show up as  
statistically significant.  
  Finally, capital goods imports  are particularly difficult to model. Most of the  
variables are not statistically significant or implausibly large in absolute value. The  
standard error of regression is also large (0.061) relative to that for the other regressions  
for the other aggregates. A similar result obtains for capital goods imports, where the  
SER is 0.055.   
  One feature of the results in Table 5 is  that when disaggregating, allowing for  
supply effects, and changing trade costs, then the estimated price elasticities are typically  
higher than for the specifications reported in  Tables 2 and 3.11 Future work will involve  
aggregating up the price elasticities for the components to obtain a more accurate  
measure of the aggregate price elasticity.  
                                                 
11 
  One exception is for capital goods imports. In  that case, a statistic ally significant price  elasticity cannot be obtained.  
12 

========14========

4. Summary  
In this paper the data for U.S. trade flows up to 2010q1 are investigated. A variety of  
different trade aggregates are examined. In addition, supply side factors and the  
implications of vertical specialization are accounted for. A number of conclusions are  
derived from this assessment.  
First, the examination confirms that the Houthakker-Magee finding of income  
asymmetries persists into the most recent period. This characterization applies most  
strongly to specifications involving highly aggregated trade flows, and no role for supply  
or other factors.   
Second, the disaggregation of trade flows into services and some subcategory of  
goods usually yields higher estimated price elasticities. This outcome suggests some role  
for aggregation bias in driving down estimated price elasticities. A similar finding was  
obtained in IMF (2007), but in that case, the results pertained to price elasticities for  
relative prices, instead of the real exchange rate as  in this study.  
Third, the inclusion of supply-side variables reduces the magnitude of income  
elasticities for goods. However, the results are not robust to the inclusion of time trends.  
Consequently, one can only make tentative conclusions regarding the importance of  
supply side factors in driving the increasing volume of international trade. On the other  
hand, cross-section studies of trade do suggest that the finding of a supply side role is not  
completely coincidental.  
Fourth, capital goods and non-capital goods imports, or alternatively, durable and  
nondurable goods, appear to behave differently. However, because the results are  
sensitive to the sample period and trade flow  measure, additional work is required to  
13 

========15========

identify the channels by which trade barriers and vertical specialization interact. In  
particular, one might want a better measure of trade barriers for trade in capital goods.  
Finally, it appears that disaggregation – even of a limited extent – might prove  
helpful in improving predictions of aggregate trade flows. One key dividing line appears  
to be between non-oil non-capital goods and capital goods, and between durables and  
nondurables (particularly on the export side).12 
  The results so far suggest further avenues of research.   
1. Checking the sensitivity of the results to alternative specifications, including  
additional activity variables pertaining to  specific trade fl ows (e.g., capital goods  
imports as a function of business fixed investment).  
2. Investigating the results obtained from the Johansen methodology and single  
equation error correction specifications.  
3. Incorporating different or estimated measures of trade costs.   
4. Focus on the short run dynamics of the components of trade flows, such as  
durables versus nondurables. This point is related to item (1), since there is some  
evidence that the extreme movements in  durable goods was associated with a  
particularly sharp movement in (highly procyclical) durable good production  
(Francois and Woerz, 2009).  
   
                                                 
12 
 In previous versions of this paper, I’ve  reported results that indicate that sums of  predicted import sub-aggregates appear to yield smaller prediction errors than using a  predicted aggregate import variable. This finding – while not definitive – suggests that  one can improve our forecasts of trade flows without resorting to modeling many very  highly disaggregated trade series.
