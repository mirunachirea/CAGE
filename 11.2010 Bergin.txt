Abstract  
A currency union’s ability to increase international trade is one of the most debated questions in  international macroeconomics. This paper studies the dynamics of these trade effects over time.  First, empirical work with data from the European Monetary Union finds that the extensive  margin of trade (entry of new firms or goods) responds several years ahead of overall trade  volume and actual implementation of the monetary union. This implies a fall at the intensive  margin (previously traded goods) in the run-up to EMU. A dynamic stochastic general  equilibrium model of trade studies the announcement  of a future monetary union as a news shock  lowering future trade costs, and finds that the early entry of new firms in anticipation is  explainable as a rational forward-looking response under certain conditions. Required elements  are sunk costs of exporting and ex-ante heterogeneity among firms. The findings help identify  which types of trading frictions are reduced by adopting a currency union. Findings also indicate  that a significant fraction of the welfare gains from a monetary union are based upon expectations  for the future, so that continued gains depend upon  long-term credibility of the union.

1.   Introduction  
  A currency union’s ability to increase internation al trade has been one of the most  
debated questions in international macroeconomics, especially since Rose (2000) found  
potentially large effects in historical monetary unions. Subsequent literature with improved  
methodology and expanded data, including coverage of the European Monetary Union, has  
mostly supported the statistical significance of this effect, but estimated lower magnitudes.1 
Previous work has also documented that a substantial portion of the trade effect operates at  
the extensive margin, that is, trade of goods not previously traded. 
2 
 A basic question that  
remains unanswered is the mechanism by which a currency union would have effects on  
trade. In order to help address this question, this  paper studies the dynamics of the impacts on  
trade. It identifies new stylized facts about the timing of effects at the various margins of  
trade.3  Then by constructing and simulating a dynamic stoc hastic general equilibrium model  
of trade, the paper draws implications regarding what types of trade cost reductions would be  
consistent with the observed dynamics.    
  The first contribution of the paper is to document  a stylized fact in trade data  
regarding the effects of European Monetary Union (EMU). Based on disaggregated trade  
data the paper constructs measures of the extensive  margin of trade (the entry of new goods  
categories) and the intensive margin (the amount of  trade in previously traded goods

 There is an extensive literature on this subject.  For a sampling of supporting evidence see Rose and van  Wincoop (2001), Glick and Rose (2002), and Frankel and Rose (2002). For a sampling of critiques see  Persson (2001) and Nitsch (2002); see Baldwin (2006) for a useful summary. For empirical studies of the  European Monetary Union, see Micco, Stein, and Ordonez (2003), Baldwin and di Nino (2006), Flam and  Nordstrom (2006), Berthou and Fontagne (2008), and Frankel 2010.  Estimates for the effect on trade in  the  EMU range from 5% to 20%.

 Papers studying the effect of EMU on the extensive  margin of trade, including Baldwin and di Nino  (2006), Flam and Nordstrom (2006), and Berthou and Fontagne (2008), estimate a rise in the extensive  margin in the range of 6% to 19%.  
3While Micco, Stein and Ordonez (2003) consider the timing of overall trade effects, finding that effects  begin in 1998, they do not consider the extensive margin. While Flam and Nordstrom(2006) measure the  extensive margin for years prior to EMU, their objective is to compare the pre-EMU (1995-1998)  period  to  post-EMU (2002-2005), taking the earlier period as a benchmark rather than considering the possibility  that  these early periods could themselves show an increase in the extensive margin.

categories). Panel regressions are used to identify  the effect of adopting EMU on these two  
margins of trade, where dummies are used to indicate effects in years both before and after  
actual EMU adoption. Estimates indicate that the extensive margin began to rise already four  
years ahead of actual EMU adoption. While initial increases in the extensive margin are  
small, they are found to be very significant statistically, and to grow gradually over time to  
reach a maximum 3 years after EMU adoption. These dynamics contrast sharply with the  
dynamics of overall trade, where effects become significant much later (around one year  
prior to EMU adoption), with magnitudes that initially are much smaller than the extensive  
margin. This implies that the intensive margin, the  difference between overall trade and the  
extensive margin, is negative in the run-up to EMU adoption. This effect dies out several  
years after adoption, as the extensive margin effect declines over time and the overall trade  
effect catches up.   
It is striking that new goods appear to enter the export market before the monetary  
union actually generates an increase in trade. Some  previous papers have discussed the need  
for dynamics to account for gradual adjustment to new trade opportunities, such as time to  
build to generate a sluggish response of new entry.  But the evidence here is the opposite;  
rather than being sluggish, entry instead anticipates the future trade opportunities created by  
EMU.  It is true that EMU did not become certain until a year before adoption, with  
announcement in 1998 of those countries satisfying the convergence criteria. However, when  
firms respond to shifts in expectations, the future  profit opportunities need not be known with  
certainty. Exporting may well involve one-time sunk  costs, such as one-time investment in  
distribution networks abroad.  Given that paying a sunk cost presents the opportunity but not  
the requirement to sell abroad, the option value of  establishing a presence in foreign market  
could become justified based upon rising probabilities of states of nature where exporting is  
profitable, even if these states are not realized in the end.  These facts suggest the need for

trade models augmented with expectations and forward looking behavior in response to news  
about the future.  
The second contribution is to construct a two-country DSGE model to understand  
what drives this dynamic behavior.  The model focuses on real variables and abstracts from  
money and nominal exchange rates. Because the countries joining the European Monetary  
Union previously belonged to a system of mutually fixed exchange rates, EMU is not  
associated with a significant reduction in exchange  rate volatility, or a significant change in  
monetary policy rules or shocks. Instead the model studies the adoption of a common  
currency as the elimination of trade costs of various types, frictions associated with currency  
conversion or other reduction in the significance of national borders. The model studies the  
effect of a “news shock,” whereby an announcement is made about a future reduction in these  
trade costs. These trade frictions can take one of several forms in the model: iceberg trade  
costs proportional to trade volume, fixed costs paid each period, and a one-time sunk cost.  
The model differs from Ghironi and Melitz (2005) and most models in the literature in  
assuming a distinct sunk cost for exporting, which is necessary for the extensive margin to  
respond to a news shock.   
The main theoretical finding is that an anticipation effect of monetary unions on the  
extensive margin can be explained as rational forward-looking behavior, but it requires a  
number of factors. First, the union must be expected to reduce iceberg costs of trade. Second,  
trade must involve significant sunk costs. Third, entering firms must be heterogeneous in a  
form anticipated by firms before making the entry decision.  One surprise was that the  
presence of a sunk cost decision, where firms equate the discounted stream of all future  
profits to the sunk cost, is not sufficient to generate early firm entry in anticipation of future  
profits arising from a monetary union. The reason is that firms contemplating entry in periods  
prior to the monetary union adoption correctly anticipate that entry of firms in the future  
3 

========5========

period of adoption will compete away profits in excess of the sunk cost. Given that export  
profits will be lower prior to the union adoption, there is no excess profit to motivate entry in  
earlier periods. However, heterogeneity among firms, here in terms of the size of the sunk  
costs they face, will imply that profits will remain at a higher level after the adoption, equal  
to the sunk cost of the marginal exporter. If firms  with high productivity or lower entry costs  
know this prior to making the entry decision, this implies an expectation for future profits in  
excess of sunk costs, thereby justifying their early entry.    
The model also points to iceberg costs as the key trade costs reduced by the monetary  
union adoption. A news shock reducing the sunk cost  itself leads to an exit of firms prior to  
adoption rather than the observed entry; further, a  news shock reducing the fixed cost of trade  
fails to generate the observed rise in overall export volume upon adoption. Finally, the  
finding that the extensive margin anticipates adoption suggests that a significant portion of  
the welfare gains of adopting a monetary union, which work through love of variety in utility,  
rely upon expectations of a monetary union and precede its actual adoption.  This indicates that  
continued gains from a monetary union rely upon expectations for the union’s continued  
existence in the long run; a lack of credibility in  the union could reduce the welfare gains.  
The next section of the paper discusses the empirical methodology and new stylized facts.  
Section three defines the model, and section four discusses the simulation results.  
2. Empirical Findings  
  The study uses a panel dataset which covers export s at an annual frequency from  
1973 to 2004. The trade data of 1973-2000 come from  the NBER-UN World Trade Data set,  
developed by Rob Feenstra and Robert Lipsey, documented in Feenstra et al. (2005). The  
trade data after 2000 come from the UN Comtrade Data set, developed as the same way as in  
Feenstra et al. (2005). This data set computes annual bilateral trade flows at the four-digit

        Following Hummels and Klenow (2005), the ex tensive margin is measured in a manner  
consistent with consumer price theory by adapting the methodology in Feenstra  (1994).   
The extensive margin of exports from country  j  to  m, denoted by  EM 
j 
m 
, is defined as   
        
EM 
j m 
∑X 
W 
m , i = 
i∈I 
jm 
XW 
m 
    (1)  
where  X 
W 
m i, 
 is the export value from the world to country  m  of category  i.  I 
j 
m 
 is the set of  
observable categories in which country  j  has positive exports to country  m, and  X 
W m  is the  
aggregate value of world exports to country  m. The extensive margin is a weighted count of  
j’s categories relative to all categories exported to  m, where the categories are weighted by  
their importance in world’s exports to country  m.   
        The corresponding intensive margin of expor ts from country  j  to  m, denoted as  IM 
j m  is  
defined as

i∈I 
jm 
where  X 
j 
m 
 is the total export value from country  j  to country  m. The intensive margin is  
measured as  j’s export value relative to the weighted categories  in which country  j  exports to  
country  m. Therefore, multiplying the intensive margin by the extensive margin can get  
country  j’s share of world exports to country  m,  EXShare 
j m :

 It is noted that the data purchased from the UN fo r 1984-2000 only had values in excess of $100,000, for  each bilateral flow. To be consistent, the cutoff of exports in this study is set as $100,000, which implies  that goods are considered nontradable if an export value of the category is less than $100,000.

        The categories of goods exported might diff er across exporters and change over time.  
With the same level of share of world exports to country  m  at time  t, the measurement  
implies that country  j  would have a higher extensive margin measure if it  exports many  
different categories of products to country  m, whereas, it would have a higher intensive  
margin if country  j  only export a few categories to country  m.  
        Separate panel regressions are run by regre ssing in turn the extensive margin, the  
intensive margin, and the exporter’s total share on  the currency union status as well as  
controls. Controls include membership in the European Union, which entailed economic  
reforms that could be expected to raise bilateral trade themselves, as well as the standard set  
of variables representing country size and distance  used in gravity trade models to explain  
bilateral trade. The benchmark regressions take the  form:

The model is estimated by ordinary least squares with robust standard errors clustered in  
export pair level, where  j  is the exporter and  m  is the importer. The dependent variables ( Yjm,t)   
will be either the logarithm of country  j’s extensive margin of exports to country  m, the  
logarithm of country  j’s intensive margin, or the logarithm of share of world exports.  
Regressors include dummies for the currency union status,   EMU 
jm,t 
.  A dummy for the  
European Union,  EU 
jm 
,t 
, is included to control the impact of a free trade  area on export.  
However, the European Union may become a deeper agreement and increase the impacts  
over time, so  EUTrend 
jm 
,t 
 is included to control the EU effects on export th rough time.  
The regressor  Xjm,t  is a set of variables that vary over time, which i ncludes the logarithm of  
real GDP per capita of exporter  j  relative to real GDP per capita of all countries w ho export

to importer  m, logarithm of exporter  j’s population relative to real GDP per capita of all  
countries who export to importer  m, and a dummy variable indicating whether the two  
countries had a free trade agreement at time  t.   Fjm   is a set of variables that do not vary over  
time, such as the logarithm of distance between country  j  and  m, a common language dummy,  
a land border dummy. Also included is a time effect,  t, to control for time-specific factors  
such as global shocks or business cycles.  
        To avoid omitting variables that may affect  bilateral trade, two vectors of dummy  
variables,  EX  and  IM , are included indicating exporter and importer fixed effects. As  
Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) proposed, country effects are included as controls for  
multilateral resistance. We decided to use separate  country fixed effects for each country as  
exporter and importer, because in contrast with the  related literature on trade flows, our  
dependent variable specifies the direction of trade.  
        We begin by reporting result for a sample o f 15 European countries, including 3  
countries which are not members of the monetary union. 
5 
 Initial results using country fixed  
effects are reported in the first three columns of Table 1. Joining EMU raised overall exports  
by 11.9%, which is smaller than the effects originally found by Rose but similar to those  
found by other researchers focusing on a European sample. 
6 
 The effect is slightly smaller in  
magnitude than the effect of entry into the EU. The  first column indicates that the majority of  
this trade effect occurs at the extensive margin, which rises by 6.3%. In fact, while the effect  
at the extensive margin is statistically significant, that at the intensive margin is not. This  
result emphasizes the importance of the extensive margin for understanding the trade effects

 The countries included are Austria, Belgium-Luxemb ourg, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,  Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom. Ten of these joined the  monetary union in 1999, and Greece joined in 2001. Denmark, Sweden, and United Kingdom did not join  the monetary union.   
6 
 The export share is 1.119 times higher (11.9%) bec ause exp(0.112) = 1.119; the extensive margin is 1.063  (6.3%) because exp(0.061) = 1.063.

of monetary unions.  The remaining columns confirm that this result is robust to alternative  
sets of controls, such as country-year fixed effects to control for time-varying multilateral  
resistance in the determination of the trade pattern, and country-pair fixed effects to control  
for  the bilateral tendency to trade instead of the multilateral resistance .   
  Table 2 reports result regarding the dynamics of t hese trade effects over time. The  
regression equation is augmented with leads and lags of the EMU indicator variable, to  
capture the effects of EMU before and after adoption.

The main finding is that the extensive margin rises  well ahead of the actual adoption of the  
monetary union. All three sets of estimations agree  on this point, all showing a statistically  
significant positive coefficient on all leads of the EMU indicator in their respective extensive  
margin regressions.  The magnitudes of this effect are similar to those found in table 1,  
tending to be somewhat smaller in years prior to EMU, and larger in years following actual  
adoption of EMU.  The three sets of estimations vary among themselves regarding values of  
other coefficients. Overall trade rises one year ahead of EMU adoption under country fixed  
effects and country-pair fixed effects; trade rises  earlier under country-pair fixed effects. The  
intensive margin is either insignificantly different from zero or negative in the run-up to  
EMU depending on the estimation, but tends to become significantly positive several years  
following implementation.    
  In order to get more precise estimates, we follow  Frankel (2010) in expanding the  
data set to all available countries. The NBER-UN World Trade data set covers 148 countries,  
so we include all of these in the gravity regression above. We augment the regression  
equation with an additional indicator variable to control for currency unions other than EMU.  
8 

========10========

Consequently, the EMU indicator variables remain specific to the monetary union in Europe,  
and the coefficients on these indicators can continue to be interpreted as the effect EMU.   
Results are reported in Table 3. The additional data produce highly significant  
parameter estimates both for estimations using country fixed effects and country-year fixed  
effects, and there is a close correspondence in results between these two cases. We will focus  
on results for the latter estimation, as this controls for time-varying multilateral resistance,  
which past literature has emphasized as a potential  source of bias. In contrast, estimates from  
using country pair fixed effects lack statistical significance. Country-pair fixed effects could  
be useful if trade resistance is bilateral rather than multilateral in nature. However, it  
eliminates cross-sectional variation in the panel and leaves only time-series variation.  Given  
that the vast majority of the new countries added to this larger sample have not entered or left  
a currency union during this sample period, these additional countries yield no information in  
the estimate.  See Bergin and Lin (2009) for a discussion of this point.  
Figure 1 plots the regression coefficients arising from the time-varying fixed effects  
estimation. Estimates agree with the main conclusion of Table 2, showing a significant rise in  
the extensive margin in anticipation of EMU adoption, but estimates here offer greater  
precision and details about the dynamics. The extensive margin effect can now be seen to rise  
smoothly and gradually over time.  Estimates are small and insignificantly different from  
zero for initial years, but the effect becomes significant starting four years prior to EMU  
adoption. This contrasts with the overall effect on  trade, which does not become significant  
until much later, one or two years before EMU adoption depending on the criterion for  
significance. The magnitude of the extensive margin  effect in these periods is also much  
larger than that on overall trade. This implies that the effect on the intensive margin of trade,  
the difference between overall and extensive margin, is actually negative. We can confirm  
that the difference between the two is statically significant, as Column 8 of Table 3 reports  
9 

========11========

coefficients in the intensive margin regression, and shows that EMU dummies are  
significantly negative for all periods preceding EMU adoption.   
The figure also shows that the dynamics change after EMU adoption. The extensive  
margin effect reaches its maximum about 3 years after adoption, and then falls in remaining  
years. At this point the overall trade effect nearly catches up with the extensive margin. At  
this point, overall trade and the extensive margin rise 44% and 55% respectively. This is  
larger than the estimates from the European country  sample in Table 2, though still much  
smaller than estimates of currency union effects from the work of Rose. These larger values  
do correspond with those found in Frankel (2010), which argued that an expanded data set, in  
terms of time an countries, is helpful in detecting  EMU effects. The narrowing of the  
difference between extensive margin and overall trade after EMU adoption is confirmed by  
the fact that the intensive margin coefficients are  no longer significantly negative.    
  It is striking that new goods appear to entry the  export market before the monetary  
union actually generates an increase in trade. Why would firms enter a market when a  
constant level of trade must be divided among more firms, presumably leading to a fall in  
profits? Given that trade does eventually rise, this entry would seem to indicate forward  
looking behavior on the part of firms, in response to news about future policy changes and  
rise in opportunities for trade. Such anticipation effects cannot be explained in the context of  
a standard static trade model, where trade and entry occur simultaneously.  Some previous  
papers have discussed the need for dynamics to account for gradual adjustment to new trade  
opportunities, such as time to build to generate a sluggish response of new entry. But the  
evidence here is the opposite; rather than being sluggish, entry instead anticipates the future  
10 

========12========

trade opportunities. These facts suggest the need for trade models augmented with  
expectations and forward looking behavior in response to news about the future.7 
3. Benchmark Theoretical Model  
Consider a model of two symmetric countries, home and foreign, which trade with  
each other. Engaging in trade involves paying several types of trade costs: iceberg costs,  
fixed costs each period, and a one-time sunk cost. The model differs from Ghironi and Melitz  
(2005) and most models in the literature in assuming a distinct sunk cost for exporting. 
8 
  The  
ability to generate an anticipation effect in the extensive margin in response to a news shock  
depends upon a sunk cost associated with exports.   
Although the model is motivated by study of a monetary union, the model focuses on  
real variables and abstracts from money and nominal  exchange rates. Because the countries  
joining the European Monetary Union previously belonged to a system of mutually fixed  
exchange rates, EMU is not associated with a reduction in exchange rate volatility, or any  
significant change in monetary policy rules or shocks. Instead the model studies the adoption  
of a common currency as the elimination of trade costs associated with currency conversion  
or other reduction in the significance of national borders.   
3.1   Goods market structure    
        Overall demand ( D) in the home country is an aggregate of  n 
H 
 varieties of home  
goods and   n 
F 
 varieties of goods exported from the foreign count ry. The aggregator is CES,  
with a potentially distinct elasticity between home  and foreign goods aggregates ( φ ), and  
                                                 
7 
 The dynamic models of Ghironi and Melitz (2005) in cludes forward looking behavior, but it does not  study anticipated future changes in trade liberalization, so like standard trade models, it does not study the  possibility of trade response in the absence of a current rise in trade volume.

3.2  Home household problem   
  The representative home household derives utility  from consumption ( C) and  
disutility from labor ( L). Households derive income by selling their labor  ( L) at the nominal  
wage rate ( W), receiving real profits from home firms (Π ).There is no international asset  
trade, so trade is balanced between the two countries.  
  Household optimization for the home country may be  written:

3.3  Home firm problem    
  There are two types of home firms, those selling i n the domestic market and those  
that engage in export. The markets are monopolistically competitive, with free entry subject  
to a one-time sunk cost,  K 
Ht 
for domestic firms and  K 
* 
Ht 
for exporters. We view this setup cost  
as a type of investment analogous to that in physical capital in other DSGE models.   Home  
exports to the foreign market are subject to a fixed export cost each period  F 
* 
Ht 
t, in units of  
labor, as well as a proportional iceberg trade cost,  τ 
* 
Ht 
. It is assumed that fraction  δ  of firms  
must exogenously exit the market each period.  Production for all firms is linear in labor:

for each of these. The 44 equilibrium conditions are: price indexes and demands for types of  
goods (8)-(14), labor supply (15), profit and firm value (17-18, 23-24), price setting (19,25),  
entry and new firms (20-21, 26-27), market clearing  for goods and labor markets (28, 29),  
definition of overall demand (30), and the foreign counterparts for all of these, along with  
balanced trade (31), and choice of the home consumption bundle as numeraire:   
P =1.  (33)  
  The model is solves as a linear approximation.   
3.5  Calibration  
The macro parameters are taken at standard real business cycle values:  ρ = 1 (log utility),  
ψ =1 (unitary labor supply elasticity),  µ =6 (implying a price markup of 20%), and  β =0.96  
to represent an annual frequency. The elasticity of  substation between home and foreign  
goods is calibrated at  φ =2, as recommended by Ruhl (2008) which studies the  elasticity  
puzzle (we note that this calibration is not essential to our results). We calibrate δ =0.10 as in  
Ghironi and Melitz (2005) to match data on the annual job destruction rate of 10%. Home  
17 

========19========

bias in preferences is set at  θ =0.66 so that the trade share in GDP is 70%, which is  
representative for EU counties (European Commission, 2006).  
Trade costs are calibrated based on outside studies. The steady state iceberg cost  τ 
H 
*  is  
set to 0.10, as used in Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000).  The sunk costs are normalized at  
K KH H= 
* 
= 1, with the fixed costs  set at  F 
* 
H 
 =0.07 so that  21 % of total home firms export  
(as in Ghironi and Melitz, 2005).  
4. Simulation Results  
4.1. Benchmark model  
  Figure 2 reports impulse responses to a drop in ic eberg trade costs announced in  
period 1 that will occur in period 8, which we will  refer to as period T. The size of the shock  
is calibrated so that exports rise by the 20% observed in the empirical section, which requires  
about a 15% fall in the iceberg cost. Note, the anticipated shock leads to no effect on any of  
the variables prior to period T; exports and the extensive margin both rise first in the period  
where the trade costs actually fall.  This may seem  surprising, since one might think that the  
presence of sunk costs in the entry decision should  lead more firms to enter if there is an  
anticipated future rise in profits. But careful examination of  the entry condition combining  
(23) and (26)

  (34)  
   c t t t, 
reveals why this intuition does not apply to sunk costs in the presence of news shocks.   
Equation (34) makes clear that a firm contemplating  entry discounts future profits by the  
stochastic discount factor, here the ratio of current consumption to that consumption in the  
18 

========20========

future period.  Figure 1 indicates that consumption  rises permanently in period  T  in a way  
that mimics the rise in profits. As a result future  profits properly discounted do not rise, and  
therefore provide no motivation for entry prior to period T.  However, once period  T  arrives  
and sales rise, higher entry is justified. In periods after  T, higher sales raise total profits, and  
entry will occur until the rise in profits per firm  exactly equals the rise in sunk cost (due to  
rise in real wage). Period  T  is unique, in that new entrants enjoy the higher s ales of the new  
regime but pay the lower fixed costs of the old regime in  T-1. This feature will be discussed  
further below.  
  The conclusion of no entry in anticipation of the  shock may seem the product of a  
very special set of circumstances, but it is actually highly robust. There is no calibration of  
the parameters in the model above that leads to any  significant extensive margin entry in  
anticipation of the shock.  The general principle, which I believe is outlined here for the first  
time in the literature, may be described as follows. Begin by considering firm decisions in  
period  T-1 for entry in period  T:  firms will progressively enter this period until discounted  
profits per firm are driven down to the point that they just barely covers the sunk cost of entry,  
with no extra profits left over. Firms considering entry in the period prior to  T  anticipate this  
future entry, and their decision is identical, except that entry in  T-1 means there is an  
additional period where sales have not yet risen. Entry in period  T-1 would imply a fall in  
profits per firm in that initial period, so entry in  T-1 implies a stream of profits that will not  
cover the sunk cost of entry.  The fact that firms correctly anticipate future entry that eats up  
future extra profits removes the incentive to enter  in any earlier period.   
4.2. Productivity heterogeneity  
  One might think that firm heterogeneity could alte r this result. If some firms are more  
productive than others, these will have profits even after less productive firms enter in later  
19 

========21========

periods, which would justify immediate entry of the  most productive firms. We follow the  
convention for modeling firm heterogeneity under a sunk cost as discussed in Ghironi and  
Melitz (2005), hereafter GM. Firms pay the sunk cost of entry before knowing their  
productivity draw, so that the sunk cost decision depends upon expectations of productivity,  
that is, firm averages. 
9 
 Our model differs from GM in that we wish to speci fy a sunk cost  
associated with the exporting decision not just firm entry into the domestic market. As in the  
benchmark model above, this is facilitated by assuming that exportable and domestically  
consumed goods are produced by distinct sectors populated by two distinct sets of firms, so  
that firm creation in the export sector is synonymous with entry into the export market.   
  For firms in the export sector, a firm-specific pr oductivity term z  augments  
production:  y i AzL i= . Following GM, firm productivity is assumed to follow a Pareto

sector consisted of   n

 An alternative would be to allow firms to pay the  sunk cost after knowing their productivity draw as in  Ruhl (2008). This would greatly amplify the complexity of model solution, as one would need to track the  productivity levels of all firms at all periods, rather than taking aggregate variables as functions of average  productivity as in Ghironi and Melitz (2005). We consider the possibility of heterogeneity known at the  time of entry later in the paper, where heterogeneity takes a form that does not pose this problem for  model  
solution.

  Calibrations follow GM, setting  zmin to 1 and choosing  k  so that the standard deviation  
of firm size, which equals 1 1(k − +µ ) , is 1.67 to match evidence on the firm size  
distribution.  
Figure 3 reports the impulse response to a pre-announced 15% reduction in iceberg  
trade cost. As in the previous model without firm heterogeneity, the figure shows there is no  
rise in the number of exporting firms in periods prior to the trade cost reduction. The intuition  
is that firms do not know before paying the sunk cost whether they will have high or low  
productivity, so heterogeneity has no impact on the  sunk cost decision above. Firms  
considering the possibility of early entry expect to have the same productivity as later  
entrants, so they expect that their future profits will be the same as that for later entrants. As  
in the previous experiment, firms expect future entry will bid down profits to the point of just  
covering sunk costs of those future entrants. So early entry in periods of lower or negative  
initial profits cannot be justified by an expectation of higher than average future profits for  
those early entrants.   
4.3 Other types of heterogeneity  
  Another form that heterogeneity could take would b e in sunk trade costs.  Following  
Ruhl (2008), suppose a distribution of sunk costs  G K K K( ) = 
( 
) 
χ 
, where  K is an upper  
bound on the sunk cost, and  χ  characterizes heterogeneity. Denoting the full set  of potential  
exporters as  n 
* 
H 
 and the set of entrants at the end of a period as  nx n ne= + 
* * * 
H H H 
, we write  
21 

========23========

nx G K n* *H H= ( ) , which implies the sunk cost of the marginal entrant rises with the  
fraction of potential firms engaged in the market: K nx n K= 
( ) 
1 
* * χ 
H t H, 
. This requires that  
the entry condition be written in terms of the marginal firm, i n=

Note this entry condition is different from Ghironi  and Melitz (2005) in that it applies to the  
marginal firm, evaluated after the value of the heterogeneous sunk cost is known, rather than  
being evaluated for average firm value, based on expected values of the heterogeneous term.  
It also is simpler than the specification of Ruhl (2008), in that there is no heterogeneity in  
firm marginal costs or profits, which would require  a different and much more complex  
solution method to track the evolution of heterogeneity. The main point is that firms can be  
ranked at any given point in time in terms of their  willingness to enter the export market, and  
it is the sunk cost of the marginal firm that determines the equilibrium level of profit per firm  
in each period. So while the profit per firm after entry in period  T  will just cover the sunk  
cost of the marginal new entrant, it will more than  cover the lower sunk cost of the other  
entrants that period, with extra profit left over. Since firms are forward looking, these firms  
will correctly anticipate these excess profits, and  see a motivation for entry in earlier periods.  
Future entrants will not eat up all extra profits, because these later firms must deal with  
higher sunk costs.   
  Aggregating over heterogeneous sunk costs, the res ource constraint becomes:

  (37)  
22 

========24========

The parameter  χ  is calibrated at 0.190, the values implied by the  calibration in Ruhl (2008)  
if there is no correlation with productivity heterogeneity.11  The maximum sunk cost in the  
distribution,  K , is taken to be twice the value of the sunk cost assumed in earlier simulations,  
and the maximum number of exporters,  n 
* 
H 
, is assumed to be  twice the steady state number  
of exporters in earlier simulations.  
  Simulations reported in Figure 4 indicate signific ant entry investment immediately in  
the period where the shock is announced, leading to  a larger number of firms starting in the  
second period. Profits fall in the initial period, as new entrants divide up the given export  
sales among more competitors. But entry occurs nonetheless, because the fall in current  
profits is compensated by higher future profits for  these firms with low sunk costs. As the  
date of the shock approaches, yet further firms enter, as there are a smaller number of periods  
of lower profits before the higher profits begin in  period  T, making the present value of entry  
positive for a wider subset of the distribution of firms. Note also that the response in overall  
exports differs from that of the number of firms, in that it does not rise prior to the actual  
shock. This coincides nicely with the empirical evidence reported earlier that the extensive  
margin responded to EMU several years ahead of overall exports. The reason is that while the  
extensive margin is driven mainly by sunk costs and  forward looking behavior, the demand  
for imports is driven primarily by the relative price and hence by iceberg trade costs in that  
period.   
Experiments indicate that the degree of entry in the initial period is not sensitive to  
the curvature of the distribution, summarized by  χ , but it is sensitive to other parameters  
                                                 
11 
 Ruhl (2008) introduces sunk cost heterogeneity in  order to explain the entry of small exporters, which  requires a correlation of sunk cost heterogeneity with productivity heterogeneity. The purpose here is different, and introducing of Ruhl’s productivity heterogeneity would not be solvable using our current  methods. We borrow the specification and calibration of sunk cost heterogeneity from Ruhl for  convenience. The result is robust to alternative calibrations of the parameters.   
23 

========25========

such as the deprecation rate (probability of exogenous firm exit). Figure 5 demonstrates that  
for a lower deprecation rate ( δ = 
0.01 ), initial firm entry in anticipation of the shock equals  
about two thirds of the full entry when the shock is later realized. Firms are more willing to  
enter if they are more likely to still be around to  reap the benefits of the extra profits in the  
future.  
The result is also sensitive to the intertemporal elasticity of households,  1 ρ , because  
this determines the stochastic discount factor used  to discount future profits,  (C C 
ρ 
t s t+ 
) .  
Recall from discussion of Figure 1 that the ability  of future profits to encourage entry is  
dampened by the rise in consumption and the discounting of these future profits.  A lower  
value of  ρ  lowers the degree of discounting implied by rising  consumption. Figure 6 shows  
the case where  ρ  = 0.3, so that the rise in future profits has grea ter power to encourage new  
entry. Recall that the entry decision for entry in period  T  is unique, in that new entrants  
benefit from the increased sales induced by the shock but do not pay sunk cost at the higher  
wage rate induced by the shock, so there is the possibility of some degree of overshooting in  
the amount of entry in the initial period of the shock above the long-run level. This  
overshooting was precluded in Figure 2 by the fact that future rises in consumption led to  
greater discounting of future profits. But the figure shows that this overshooting occurs once  
the discounting is dampened. This offers one potential explanation to the empirical finding  
that the extensive margin has its maximum effect right around the time of EMU  
implementation, and the extensive margin retreats somewhat thereafter.  
Finally, the model is used to evaluate the effects of cuts in alternative costs. Figure 7  
reports the result of a news shock cutting the sunk  cost of exporting firms by 1% in period 8,  
announced in period 1. The model simulated includes  sunk cost heterogeneity as described  
above. Entry actually falls in the periods after the announcement, as firms wait for the lower  
24 

========26========

sunk costs before entering. This fall in entry is at odds with the empirical evidence, and  
suggests that EMU does not raise trade primarily by  lowering sunk costs. Figure 8 studies the  
effect of a shock lowering the fixed cost of trade FH t 
* 
, 
in period 8, announced in period 1. This  
shock does predict a rise in entry prior to the shock. But it fails to predict the sizeable rise in  
exports; exports rise only a small fraction as much  the rises in entry, as the extra trade arises  
solely form love for variety. The failure to induce  a rise in trade suggests that EMU does not  
work primarily through lower fixed costs of trade.  
4.4 Learning by Doing  
Consider finally the possibility of learning by doing, whereby firms become more  
efficient at producing if they engaged in production and export previously. Such learning by  
doing has been used in the macroeconomic literature  for other purposes such as generating  
endogenous persistence.12  In the present context, one might expect that if e xporting firms  
become more efficient from experience, this might induce firms to enter prior to EMU  
implementation, so that they are prepared to take greater advantage of these trade  
opportunities when they arise later.  
Learning by doing will be modeled here in terms of the fixed cost of production,  F.13 
Firms that were previously producing and active in the export market have acquired  
experience that lowers their fixed cost in future periods. For simplicity we assume there is a  
one-time permanent reduction in fixed costs of a given export firm by fraction ζ  starting in  
the firm’s second period of production.

 See for example Lahiri and Johri (2008).

 Learning by doing is typically introduced by speci fying marginal costs of production as a negative  function of past output levels. This version is not  possible in the context of a sunk cost of entry, a s it would  lead to a proliferation of state variables. We would have to keep track of each generation of new entrants  over all past periods, and how long they have been present in the market, in order to specify their marginal  costs. This would produce a complex cross-sectional  distribution of marginal costs that would be diffi cult  to aggregate over.

  Figure 9 reports impulse responses for the usual c ut in iceberg trade costs used in  
earlier simulations. Again results show there is no  entry prior to the period of implementation.  
It is true that learning by doing makes firms more willing to enter during initial periods of  
low profits in periods before EMU implementation. But this incentive also applies to firms  
that enter later in the period of implementation. Because they too are willing to enter with a  
lower level of initial period profits, there is greater entry in the period of implementation,  
which brings down the equilibrium level of profit per firm in that period. Firms  
contemplating entry in earlier periods anticipate this additional future entry and the resulting  
lower future profits. This offsets the incentive for early entry, resulting in no extra entry in  
early periods.  
5. Conclusion  
  A currency union’s ability to increase internation al trade is one of the most debated  
questions in international macroeconomics. This paper employs a DSGE model to study the  
dynamics of these trade effects. First, original empirical work with data from the European  
26 

========28========

Monetary Union finds that the extensive margin of trade (entry of new goods) responds ahead  
of the intensive margin (increased trade of existing goods). The number of products being  
traded begins to rise several years prior to the currency union adoption, peaking near the time  
of adoption and attenuating somewhat thereafter. A DSGE model indicates that this dynamic  
response in firm entry is explainable as a rational  forward-looking response to a news shock  
about a future monetary union which is expected to lower iceberg (ie. proportional) trade  
costs, and where entry in the foreign market involves a one-time sunk cost that is  
heterogeneous across goods. The model indicates that alternative explanations for a currency  
union trade effect, that it lowers the sunk cost or  a fixed but repeated cost of trade, are  
inconsistent with the dynamics of the extensive margin evidence. This finding helps identify  
which types of trading frictions are reduced by adopting a currency union, and it indicates  
that a significant fraction of the welfare gains from a monetary union are dependent upon the  
expectation by traders that a monetary union will continue to exist in the future.
