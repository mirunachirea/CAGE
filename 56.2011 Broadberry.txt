Abstract: This paper offers a historical appraisal of recent developments in the theory of very long run  growth, focusing on two main  areas:  (1) linkages between wages, population and human capital and (2) interactions between institutions, markets and  technology. Historians as well as economists have recently begun to break away from  the  traditional  practice  of  using  different  methods  to  analyse the  world  before  and  after the industrial revolution. However, tensions remain between the theoretical and  historical  literatures,  particularly  over  the  unit  of  analysis  (the  world  or  particular  countries) and the role of historical contingency.

I. INTRODUCTION 
There  has  been  a  strong revival  of  interest  in  very  long  run  growth  amongst  
economists in the last decade or so, including unified growth theory (Galor and Weil,  
2000, Galor, 2005) and the economics of institutions (North, 1990; Greif, 2006). This  
paper  examines  these  developments in  theory,  and  assesses  their  significance  for  
economic  history.  It  is  argued  that  economic  historians  have  made  parallel  
discoveries,  with  both  theoretical  and  historical  literatures  sharing  a refusal  to  
recognise  the  traditional  practice  of  using  different  methods  to  analyse  the  world  
before and after the industrial revolution. However, there are also tensions between  
the two literatures, with theorists often content to work with models where the unit of  
analysis is the world and an industrial revolution is inevitable. Historians, by contrast,  
tend to make use of cross-sectional variation, emphasising specific European and even  
British  features  of  the  industrial  revolution,  and  allowing  an  important  role  for  
historical contingency.  
The paper begins with an examination of recent developments in two strands  
of the theoretical literature: (1) “unified growth theory” provides a new framework for  
modelling  the  transition  from  a  Malthusian  regime  with  a  negative  relationship  
between  real  wages  and  population  to  a  modern  growth  regime  with  a  positive  
relationship  between  these  two  variables,  with  a  central  role  for  human  capital  in  
bringing  about  both  an  industrial  revolution  and  a  demographic  transition (Galor,  
2005). (2) New institutional economics has made progress in modelling the key role  
of  institutions  in  solving the  “fundamental  problem  of  exchange” and  creating  an  
environment  where  economic  growth  is  possible  (North,  1990;  Greif,  2006).  In  
addition, Schumpeterian endogenous growth models have developed a framework for  

========3========

3 
modelling the link between institutions and technology, via the patent system (Aghion  
and Howitt, 1998; Carlin and Soskice, 2006).  
There  have  also  been  important  developments  in  the historical  literature on  
very long run growth in the two areas outlined above: (1) In addition to the “Great  
Divergence” between Europe and Asia, economic historians have identified a “Little  
Divergence” within Europe between Britain and Holland on the one hand, and the rest  
of the continent on the other hand. Britain and Holland managed to maintain the real  
wage  gains  of  the  immediate  post-Black  Death  period  while  limiting  fertility and  
making  a  sustained  investment in  human  capital.  These  countries  also  experienced  
growth  of  real  GDP  per  capita  during  the  late  medieval  and  early  modern  period  
despite stagnation in the daily real wage, as a result of the “Industrious Revolution”. 
These  developments  suggest  that  it  will  be  necessary  to  go  back  to  the  medieval  
period to fully understand the transition to modern economic growth (2) Institutions  
played an important role in the general economic development of late medieval and  
early modern Europe. Britain and Holland were the only two countries to succeed in  
overthrowing  absolutist  government  during  the  early  modern  period.  These  two  
countries also played a leading role in the development of private order institutions,  
with growing commercialisation showing up in a dramatic decline in the share of the  
labour  force  engaged  in  agriculture  and  a  sharp  rise  in  the  level  of  urbanisation.  
Interactions between institutions, markets and technology played an important role in  
the British overtaking of Holland, which marked the final stages of the transition to 
sustained modern economic growth. Innovation flourished in an environment where a  
patent  system  protected  intellectual  property,  there  was  a  large  market,  and  factor  
prices provided an incentive to use machine-intensive methods.

This paper  emphasises  the  common  themes  in  these  recent  theoretical  and  
historical developments. A concluding section nevertheless considers the difficulties  
of  combining  the  two  literatures.  It  is  difficult  to  improve  upon the  perceptive  
comments  of  Schumpeter  (1954:  815),  who  noted  that  “There  are  such  things  as  
historical and theoretical temperaments. That is to say, there are types of minds that  
take delight in all the colors of historical processes and of individual cultural patterns.  
There are other types that prefer a neat theorem to everything else. We have use for  
both. But they were not made to appreciate one another.” Schumpeter‟s words have  
particular  force  when  applied  to  very  long  run  growth,  where  historical  narrative  
without  theory  can  seem  to  lack  direction,  but  where  theory  without  attention  to  
historical detail can all too easily result in over-simplistic generalisations. 
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THEORY  
1. Wages, population and human capital in unified growth theory 
The most influential strand of the recent theoretical literature on very long run growth  
is unified growth theory, which seeks to explain the transformation from a Malthusian  
world  with  a  negative  relationship  between  population  and  per  capita  income  to  a  
Solowian world where population and per capita income can grow together (Hansen  
and  Prescott,  2002).  The  Galor  and  Weil  (2000)  model  has  become  the  standard- 
bearer  of  unified  growth  theory,  and  can  be  explained  with  a  simple  diagrammatic  
framework  (Galor,  2005).  The  economy  moves  from  a  Malthusian  regime  (with  a  
negative relationship between real wages and population) to a post-Malthusian regime  
(with  a  strongly  positive  relationship  between  real  wages  and  population)  before  
reaching  a  modern  regime  (with  a  weaker  positive  relationship  between  real  wages  

========5========

5 
and  population).  Instead  of  separate  regimes  with  the  transition  caused  by  a  large  
shock,  Galor  and  Weil see  the  escape  from  the  Malthusian  trap  as  a  long  dynamic  
process with long periods of gradual change leading eventually to phase transitions. In  
this  respect,  unified  growth  theory  has  something  in  common  with  historical  
researchers engaged in crossing the boundaries between medieval, early modern and  
modern economic history. 
In  the  Galor  and  Weil  model,  the  development  of  the  economy  can  be  
summarised using two key relationships, the education curve and the growth curve.  
The  education  curve  captures  the idea  that  technological  progress  (rather  than  the  
higher income it creates) raises the rate of return on human capital, so that education  
(e) is an increasing function of the growth rate of technology (g): 
et 
1 
e ( gt 
1) 
(1) 
The growth cu 
rve captures the idea that a high level of education in turn generates a  
high rate of technological progress: 
gt 
1 
g ( e 
t 
; Lt) 
(2) 
Note, however, that the growth curve is also affected by the size of the labour force  
and hence by the populati 
on size  
(L). This is the familiar scale effect of endogenous  
growth models. 
The development of the economy can be characterised by three regimes, with  
different population sizes: small, moderate and large. The small population regime is  
illustrated by Figure 1A. With a small population, the only steady state equilibrium is  
with zero education and slow technical progress (e 
,g) 
(0, 
gl) . In Figure 1B, with a  
moderate size population (Lm), the growth curve has now shifted up to create the  

========6========

6 
possibility of multiple equilibria. The steady state equilibrium of zero education and a  
low rate of technological progress (e 
,g) 
( o , gl) is locally stable, as is the  
equilibrium with a high level of education and a high growth rate (e,g 
) 
( e 
h, 
gh).  
There also exists an interior steady state (e,g 
) 
( e 
u 
, gu) which is unstable. In Figure  
1C, with a large population, the growth curve shifts up further, so that there is now a  
unique globally stable steady state equilibrium (e,g 
) 
( e 
h, 
gh) with high levels of  
education and technological progress. 
The intuition behind the model can be described as follows. The economy  
starts out in a Malthusian regime with a small population at the subsistence level of  
per capita income. There is no education and there is only very slow exogenous  
technological progress. In this world, population expands with technological progress  
in the standard Malthusian way. This follows from assumptions about preferences,  
with members of the current generation maximising the utility of their children as well  
as themselves. Over time, slow growth of the population under the Malthusian regime  
raises the rate of technological progress, shifting the growth curve upwards. This  
induces a shift into the moderate population regime, with multiple steady states. One  
equilibrium is the old Malthusian steady state with slow technological progress and  
zero education, but there is also a high education, high growth equilibrium. What  
happens to population growth depends on the balance of two effects. First, there is an  
income effect. As society gets richer, parents can afford to devote more resources to  
child rearing, and this increases population growth. But second, there is a substitution  
effect. Parents wish to give their children more education to cope with the  
technological progress, leading to a substitution of quality for quantity, because  
education requires resources. At first, the income effect dominates, as a previously  

========7========

7 
binding subsistence constraint is relaxed. This is the Post-Malthusian regime,  
characterised by an acceleration of both population and per capita income growth.  
However, in the long run, this effect from the relaxation of the subsistence constraint  
disappears and the substitution effect dominates. The economy then passes through a  
demographic transition and population growth slows down. This is the Modern  
regime. 
Note  the  importance  of  the  scale  effect  in  the  Galor  and  Weil  model,  with  
population  growth  shifting  up  the  growth  curve  in  Figure  1  and  bringing  about an  
industrial  revolution  via  an  acceleration  of  technological  progress.  However,  this  
makes it hard to understand the technological stagnation of large economies such as  
Mughal India or Qing Dynasty China. Indeed, in the run up to the British industrial  
revolution, China‟s population expanded from 100 million in 1685 to 300 million in  
1790 (Mokyr, 2005: 1148-1149). This issue is addressed by Jones (2001), who asks  
the  question  “was  the  industrial  revolution  inevitable?”  Although  he  models  the  
demographic transition in much the same way as Galor and Weil (2000), Jones (2001)  
dampens the feedback from population to technology. With a smaller scale effect, as  
in Jones (1995), institutional change is then required to bring about an acceleration in  
the rate of technological progress. The institutional change is modelled by Jones as an  
exogenous  shift  in  the  parameter  π,  defined  as  the  share  of  consumption  paid  to  
compensate inventive effort. Without such a shock, the industrial revolution, by which  
Jones  (2001:  32-33)  means  “the  onset  of  rapid  population  growth  and  per  capita  
growth  culminating  in  the  large  increase  in  standards  of  living  during  the  20 
th 
century”,  does  not  occur.  However,  institutions  remain  a  black  box  in  the  Jones  
model, which is unfortunate given the large amount of effort devoted to understanding  

========8========

institutions and institutional change in recent years, which will be considered in a later  
section. 
2. Unified evolutionary growth theory 
Before moving on to consider institutions, it is worth pausing to consider a recent  
development of unified growth theory, which uses an evolutionary approach, and  
avoids the need for the scale effect which was criticised in the previous section. The 
approach was pioneered by Galor and Moav (2002), and combines Darwinian  
elements with features of the basic Galor and Weil (2000) model outlined earlier.  
Individual preferences are defined over the quantity and “quality” of children, as well  
as over consumption above subsistence: 
ui t 
(1 
)lncit 
[lnnit 
i ln 
hit 
1] 
(3) 
where  
u is utility, c is consumption, h is the level of human capital, β reflects the  
preference of parents for quality, the superscript i indexes individuals and the  
subscript t indexes time. The population consists of two homogenous groups of type a  
and b, with the “quality types” attaching a higher preference parameter β than the  
“quantity types” (βa > βb). Figure 2A shows how technological progress affects the  
choice of investment in quality for both types of individual. Investment in quality  
increases with the rate of technological progress because of the increased demand for  
skilled labour. Galor and Moav assume that as the rate of technological progress (g)  
increases, the share of quantity types (q) at first declines, but then increases, which  
introduces a non-convexity to the education curve. 
In Figures 2B and 2C, the Galor-Moav model behaves in a similar way to the  
Galor-Weil model. However, note that the axes have been reversed and it is now the  

========9========

9 
education curve rather than the growth curve which shifts over time. In Figure 2B, the  
position of the education curve is pinned down by the small share of quality types in  
the population. In this Malthusian era, in the absence of large shocks, the economy  
remains stuck in a locally stable equilibrium with a low rate of technological progress  
and a low level of education (gL, eL). The equilibrium (gU, eU) is unstable. The  
Darwinian aspect of the model then comes into play to shift the education curve  
upwards, since the quality types are assumed to enjoy an evolutionary advantage  
during the Malthusian regime, having more surviving children. In Figure 2C, there is  
now a unique globally stable steady state with a high rate of technological progress  
and a high level of education (gH, eH). 
Galor and Moav do not offer much detail about the way in which human  
evolution occurs, but the approach has been taken up by Clark (2007), who argues  
that the Industrial Revolution occurred in Britain as the result of an evolutionary  
process improving the quality of the British population. There are, however, some  
obvious problems with the argument. First, the time scale being considered here is  
rather short for human evolution, which is normally seen as occurring over millennia  
rather than decades or even centuries. Second, the marriage of Darwinian and  
Malthusian elements is distinctly uneasy, because the Darwinian approach requires  
the group with the more successful strategy to increase its share of the population,  
while the dominant strategy is to have fewer children who are better educated. The  
Malthusian worry has always been the growing share of the uneducated masses.  
Although Galor and Moav accept this for the post-demographic transition period, they  
retain the assumption of an evolutionary advantage to quality types during the  
Malthusian era. Third, this assumption rests on the slender empirical basis of a single  

========10========

10 
study by Clark and Hamilton (2006), which examined a sample of 2,250 English wills  
for the period 1585-1638 and found a positive association between wealth (and hence  
literacy) and the number of surviving children. Fourth, if behavioural traits such as  
hard work and time preference are passed on socially through families and wider  
society rather than bred into the genetic make-up, unified evolutionary growth theory  
becomes difficult to distinguish from the institutional approach, which Clark is so  
keen to disparage. 
3. Institutions, markets and technology 
There has been much theoretical work on the institutional changes which underpinned  
the economic development of Europe from the middle ages, with North (1990)  
establishing the general framework. We will examine here the specific contribution of  
Greif (2000), who adopts a more formal; approach, usingthe game of trust or one- 
sided prisoner‟s dilemma to analyse what he calls the fundamental problem of  
exchange (FPOE): how can you be sure that the other side to a bargain will fulfil their  
contractual obligations? The game is set out in Figure 3. Player I chooses either to  
initiate a trade (exchange) or not to initiate the trade (don‟t exchange). If he plays  
“don‟t exchange” then no trade occurs and both agents receive pay-off 0, denoted (0,  
0). If player I does initiate trade by choosing “exchange”, then player II must decide  
whether to cooperate (player II plays “exchange-cooperate) or to renege, for example,  
by running off with the goods that player I has offered, giving nothing in return.  
Assume that if there is cooperation then gains from trade are given by γ>0, shared  
between the two players, so player I gets γ-W and player II gets W. This is the most  
satisfactory outcome, where both players gain. However, player II can do better by  
reneging and walking off with the goods; then player II gets α>W and player I faces a  

========11========

11 
loss, with a pay-off δ<0. Note that if player I initiates trade, it is individually rational  
for player II to renege. But player I can anticipate this response, and so should not  
initiate trade. This means that the gains from trade (γ) will not be realized, as in Third  
World countries today and Europe in the Dark Ages. How is it possible to get out of  
this situation? In theory, player II must be able to credibly commit to not reneging. In  
practice, medieval Europe developed institutions such as merchant guilds for  
mitigating the FPOE. Guilds were able to regulate relations between merchants and  
also to defend merchants against expropriation by the state.It should be noted that  
Greif (1994) analyses more sophisticated models to deal with games played over more  
than one period, but the focus remains on how institutions deter opportunistic  
behaviour.  
This work is very helpful in understanding the long build up to modern  
economic growth emphasised by economic historians such as Britnell and Campbell  
(1995), with the British industrial revolution having long roots in the  
commercialisation of the economy from the late middle ages. The emphasis here is on  
the development of private order institutions. Yet Greif (2006) also recognises the  
importance of state institutions, since the existence of an effective state can make the  
enforcement of property rights easier for individuals. Indeed, one strand in the  
literature which applies new institutional economics to economic development in  
history emphasises the importance of political developments such as the Dutch  
Revolt, which led to the de facto independence of the United Provinces from 1579,  
and the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which established constitutional monarchy in  
Britain (North and Weingast, 1989). The fact that these two countries led the process  
of economic development in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,  

========12========

12 
respectively, is at least suggestive of a link between the institutions of government  
and economic growth. 
It is helpful also to apply the approach of institutional economics to the  
acceleration of technological progress during the industrial revolution. In the context  
of technological innovation, entrepreneurs can afford to devote resources to the search  
for new methods only if they can be sure that others will not “run off” with their  
innovations without paying. The institutional mechanism which solves this  
fundamental problem of innovation is the patent system. However, it is not simply a  
question of the introduction of a formal system. In terms of North‟s (1990) definition  
of institutions, it is also important that the formal rules are underpinned by informal  
rules that make the system work. As MacLeod (1988: 1, 10) notes, the formal start of  
the system may be dated to the 1624 Statute of Monopolies, which was an attempt to  
end the Crown‟s abuse of letters patent, or documents by which special privileges  
were given. The statute specifically exempted patents granted for new inventions from  
its general proscription. During the seventeenth century, however, only a small  
minority of inventors filed for patents, preferring other means such as secrecy, to  
protect their intellectual property. Despite the fact that there were no changes in the  
formal institutional framework between 1624 and 1835, the system nevertheless  
developed in the light of the experience of administrators and patentees. By the mid- 
eighteenth century, MacLeod (1988: 1) suggests that the system had “developed its  
own momentum and promoteda first-strike mentality among its users: one neglected  
to patent at one‟s peril”.  

========13========

13 
The patent system plays an important role in the Schumpeterian growth model  
of Aghion and Howitt (1992; 1998), who endogenise the rate of technological  
progress through spending on research and development (R&D). The model is  
summarised in Figure 4, taken from Carlin and Soskice (2006). The Solow relation  
shows a negative steady state relationship between the rate of innovation (x) and the  
degree of capital intensity measured in efficiency units (kˆ). However, the Schumpeter  
relation shows a positive relationship between innovation and capital intensity, which  
reflects in turn a positive relationship between capital intensity and R&D spending.  
The initialequilibrium is at A. As well as depending on capital intensity, R&D  
spending is also affected by the security of property rights in innovation. The  
introduction of an effective patent system, as in Britain on the eve of the industrial  
revolution, can thusbe seen as shifting the Schumpeter relation upwards, resulting in  
a new equilibrium at B with a higher rate of innovation. An increase in the savings  
rate at the same time would shift the Solow relationship upwards, thus offsetting the  
fall in capital perunit of efficiency labour. 
III. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN HISTORY 
1. Wages, population and human capital: northwest European exceptionalism 
Recent  research  has suggested  that  northwest  Europe,  particularly  Britain  and  
Holland, developed very differently from the rest of Europe from the late middle ages.  
Since the industrial revolution occurred here, it suggests that a full understanding of  
the  take-off  to  modern  economic  growth  requires  a  study  cutting  across  the  
conventional time periods of economic history. This finding of the Little Divergence  
within Europe has followed from the recent development of comparing levels rather  
than simply growth rates of real wages in Europe. Although the necessary data have  

========14========

14 
been available since the pioneering work of the International Scientific Committee on  
Price  History  during  the  1930s,  the  early  work  using  the  data  on  wages  and  prices  
tended  to  focus  on  the  path  of  real  wages  in  an  individual  country,  or  where  
comparisons were made, tended to focus on differences in the rate of change rather  
than differences in the level (Cole and Crandall, 1964; Braudel and Spooner, 1967;  
Phelps  Brown  and  Hopkins,  1981).  This  really only changed  with  the  work  of  van  
Zanden  (1999) and  Allen  (2001),  who  made  wage  comparisons  amongst  many  
European  countries  for  the  period  after  1500,  focusing  on  levels.  Broadberry  and  
Gupta (2006) made wage level comparisons between Europe and Asia, while Pamuk  
(2007) has looked at the data back to 1300, crossing the period of the Black Death. 
Real  consumption  wages  of  European  unskilled  building  labourers  for  the  
period 1300-1850 are shown in Table 1, taking London in the period 1500-49 as the  
numeraire. The first point to note is that wages followed a similar pattern across the  
Black Death in the whole of Europe. Complete time series exist for comparatively few  
cities before 1500, but there is also scattered evidence for other cities. Taken together,  
the evidence supports the idea of a substantial rise in the real wage across the whole  
continent  of  Europe  following  the  Black  Death,  which  struck  in  the  middle  of  the  
fourteenth  century,  wiping  out  between  a  third  and  a  half  of  the  population,  when  
successive  waves  of  the  plague  are  cumulated  (Herlihy,  1997).  This  episode  of  
European economic history thus  appears to be consistent with the Malthusian model,  
with a strong negative relationship between real wages and population. In the first half  
of  the  fifteenth  century,  the  real  wage  was  quite  uniform  across  the  countries  for  
which we have data, at about twice its pre-Black Death level.  

========15========

15 
From the second half of the fifteenth century, however, Britain and Holland  
followed a very different path from the rest of Europe, maintaining real wages at the  
post-Black Death level and avoiding the collapse of real wages which occurred on the  
rest  of  the  continent.  Although  Allen  (2001)  used  the  term  Great  Divergence  to  
describe this process, the term is more usually reserved for the emerging gap in living  
standards between Europe and Asia (Pomeranz, 2000). As a result, the emerging gap  
in living standards between Britain and Holland and the rest of Europe has recently  
become known as the Little Divergence.  
Broadberry and Gupta (2006) provide some real wage evidence of the Great  
Divergence  between  Europe  and  Asia,  shown  here  in  Table  2.  The  grain  wage,  
obtained by dividing the silver wage with the silver price of grain, the most important  
consumption  item,  is  the  closest  that  we  can  get  to  the  real  consumption  wage  for  
India and China at this time. Table 2 suggests that real wages in north and south India  
and the Yangzi delta region of China were falling decisively behind those in Britain  
from  the  late  seventeenth  century,  contrary  to  the  revisionist  claims  of  Pomeranz  
(2000), Parthasarathi (1998)and Frank (1998) that the richest parts of Asia remained  
at the same level of development as the richest parts of Europe until as late as 1800.  
From  the  late  eighteenth  century,  it  becomes  possible  to  calculate  the  real  
consumption  wage  for  China,  and  Allen  et  al. (2010)  are  able  to show  that  the  
comparative Anglo-Chinese real consumption wage at this time was very close to the  
comparative Anglo-Chinese grain wage. Furthermore, the Anglo-Indian grain wage at  
this time was around the same magnitude, i.e. about one-third of the English level.  

========16========

16 
Returning  to  developments  within  Europe, a  number  of  recent  studies  have  
moved  beyond  trends  in  real  wages  to  reconstruct  national  income  back  to  the  late  
medieval  period.  For  Britain  and  Holland,  annual  estimates  of  per  capita  GDP  are  
available from the work of Broadberry et al. (2010) and van Zanden and van Leeuwen  
(2010), and are shown here in Figure 5. Holland forged ahead during its Golden Age  
between 1500 and 1650, while Britain caught up after 1650 and forged ahead during  
the Industrial Revolution of the early nineteenth century, although the precise details  
of the story of British overtaking are complicated by considerations of territory, since  
incomes were higher in England than in the rest of Britain and also higher in Holland  
than in therest of the Netherlands. 
Table 3 adds data for other European countries to reveal the Little Divergence  
pattern  in  GDP  per  capita  as  well  as  in  real  wages.  Per  capita  GDP  trended  
downwards in Italy and Germany, and stagnated at a relatively low level in Sweden.  
In Spain, although there was a temporary growth spurt with the imperial expansion of  
the sixteenth century, the downward trend in living standards was soon resumed. 
To  what  extent  can  the  Little  Divergence  be  explained  simply  in  terms  of  
demographic  factors?  The  simplest  Malthusian  approach  would  suggest  that  the  
persistence of high real wages in Northwestern Europe wasthe result of demographic  
restraint.  However,  this  is  far  from  clear  in  the  population  data  assembled  here  in  
Table  4,  taken  largely  from  Malanima  (2009a).  It  must  be  stated  at  the  outset  that  
there is considerable uncertainty about the data  particularly in the early  years, with  
estimates of the population of England in 1300 ranging from less than 4 million to  
more than 6 million (Hatcher, 1977). Whatever the pre-Black Death peak population  

========17========

17 
in  England,  there  does  nevertheless  seem  to  be  agreement  that  the  population  was  
slow to recover. This is much less clear in the rest of northwest Europe, however, with  
population well above its 1300 level already by 1500 in Belgium (Flanders), and with  
population  nearly  twice  its  pre-Black  Death  level  by  this  time  in  the  Netherlands  
(Holland). 
De  Moor  and  van  Zanden  (2010)  try  to  relate  the  Little  Divergence to  
differences in demographic and labour market behaviour. They argue that what Hajnal  
(1965)  calls  the  European  Marriage  Pattern  emerged  in  the  North  Sea  region  
following the Black Death. The key component was the primacy of mutual agreement  
over parental authority in the choice of marriage partner. The fact that both partners  
had to consent to marriage increased the bargaining position of women, and this was  
underpinned by the system of inheritance and access to the labour market. Although  
women  could  inherit  in  southern  Europe  as  well  as  in  the  northwest,  the  transfer  
occurred at the point of marriage in the south via the dowry, but upon the death of the  
woman‟s  parents  in  the northwest.  This  made  early  marriage  more  attractive  in  the  
south, since it enabled  a daughter to  gain access to the dowry, but it  also gave the  
parents  power  over  the  choice  of  partner  because  the  value  of  the  dowry  was  
uncertain. Increasingly in northwest Europe, but only to a lesser extent in the rest of  
the continent, growing access to the labour market gave a woman the power to refuse  
to  marry  an  unsuitable  partner  chosen  by  her  parents.  This  growing  access  to  the  
labour  market  by  women  seems  to  be  linked  to  the  important  role  of  the  pastoral  
sector  in  the  mixed  agriculture  that  was  prevalent  in  northwest  Europe,  and where  
women had a comparative advantage (Voigtländer and Voth, 2010). In late medieval  

========18========

18 
England, for example, Broadberry et al. (2010) find the pastoral sector accounting for  
around two-thirds of value added in agriculture. 
There  does  seem  to  be  some  evidence  in  favour  of  the idea  of  fertility  
limitation  holding  back  population  growth in  the  case  of early  modern England.  
Indeed, Wrigley et al. (1997) paint a detailed quantitative picture of fertility control  
through  late  marriage,  so  that  England  cannot  be characterised  as  being  in  a high- 
pressure Malthusian equilibrium. Figure 6 shows clearly that during the seventeenth  
century, the mean age at first marriage for males varied between 27 and 28, falling  
below  27  for  the  first  time  during  the  decade  1730-39. By  the  1830s,  it  had  fallen  
below 25. For females, the mean age at first marriage rose as high as 26.3 in the 1710s  
before  falling  to  23.1  by  the  1830s. It  is  worth  noting  that  the  increase  in  fertility  
which  accompanied  industrialisation  in  Britain  was  therefore  not  a  general  
phenomenon,  but  rather  depended  on  the  earlier  limitation  of  fertility  through  late  
marriage. This fertility limitation is also seen by Voigtländer and Voth (2006) as an  
important factor raising the probability of an industrial revolution in Britain. The case  
is more difficult to make for Holland, however, given the above-average increase in  
population over the period 1300-1500. 
The  sign  of  the  relationship  between  real  wages  and  population  clearly  
changed from negative to positive between the fourteenth and nineteenth centuries. In  
the  fourteenth  century,  the  increase  in the  real  wage was  made  possible  only  by  a  
sharp  Malthusian  fall  in  population  following  the  Black  Death.  By  the  time  of  the  
industrial revolution, by contrast, rapid population growth could be sustained together  
with a  rising  real  wage. In  the  intervening  period,  however,  it  is  not  clear  that  the  

========19========

19 
European  economy  can  really  be  characterised  as  in  a  Malthusian  regime.  Indeed,  
recent historical researchusing VAR analysis suggests that the English economymay 
have ceased  to  operate  in  a Malthusian  way much earlier  than  was  once  thought.  
Nicolini (2007) finds that the positive check (a negative relationship between the real  
wage  and  the  death  rate) disappeared  during  the  seventeenth  century  and  the  
preventive  check  (a  positive  relationship  between  the  real  wage  and  the  birth  rate)  
disappeared before 1740. However, Crafts and Mills (2009) replace the Allen (2001)  
real wage date used by Nicolini with a new real wage series produced by Clark(2005)  
and draw even more radical conclusions. Indeed, at no point during the period 1541- 
1871 were theyable to find evidence of positive checks, while evidence of preventive  
checks could only be detected until 1640.  
One important aspect of this new literature on the Little Divergence between  
Northwest Europe and the rest of the continent is the focus on the linkages between  
demographic  behaviour  and  the  performance  of  the  economy.  This  is  something  
which  had  fallen  out  of  favour  following  the  Princeton Project  on  the  Decline  of  
Fertility  in  Europe of  the  1960s and  1970s,  which rejected  a  significant  role  for 
economic and social factors in explaining the demographic transition in favour of a  
process  of  innovation  and  diffusion  driven  by  attitudes  and  networks  of  
communication (Coale and Watkins, 1986; Brown and Guinnane, 2007: 575). There  
then  followed  a  period  when  demographic  history  and  economic  history  pursued  
almost  separate  paths.  This  recent  emphasis by  economic  historians on  the  links  
between  demographic  and  economic  developments  can  be  seen  as  mirroring  the  
exploration  of  the  links  between  the  industrial  revolution  and  the  demographic  
transition  in  unified  growth  theory.  The  approach  has  been  strengthened  by the  

========20========

20 
findings of Brown and Guinnane (2007) that the Princeton Project‟s rejection of a role  
for economic factors rests on an inappropriate statistical methodology. In particular,  
Brown  and  Guinnane  are  able  to  show  for  two  important  regions  studied  by  the  
Princeton  Project  that  economic  factors  were  indeed  statistically  significant  
determinants of fertility if a lower level of aggregation is used, and if appropriate use  
is made of information on both levels and rates of change of variables. 
Economic  historians  have  also  recently  paid  more  attention  to  the  role  of  
human capital, a key variable in unified growth theory, but which had previously been  
neglected in most accounts of the industrial revolution. Again, however, the picture is  
more complex than suggested by the early unified growth models. The International  
Scientific Committee on price history collected vast amounts of data on skilled wage  
rates to complement the unskilled wage rate data presented in Table 1. This data has  
been used to calculate the skill premium in Table 5, measured as the ratio of the daily  
wage of skilled craftsmen to the daily wage of unskilled labourers. This provides a  
measure of the incentive to invest in human capital, which would be expected to rise  
at  the  time  of  the  industrial  revolution  version of  unified  growth  theory.  However,  
there  is  little  evidence  to  support  this. Although  the  premium  did  increase  in  some  
countries around the time of the industrial revolution, it fell in others, and where the  
trend was upwards, there were earlier periods when the premium was as high, if not  
higher. After a more detailed investigation of the British case using a longer run of  
annual data, Clark (2005) concludes that at the time of the industrial revolution, the  
skill premium was substantially below its medieval peak of around 2. Galor (2005: 
205)  acknowledges  this  point, but  counters  it  with  the  suggestion  that  although  the  

========21========

21 
demand for human capital was increasing, this was offset by an increase in the supply  
of human capital, in particular through the introduction of public education. 
It  is  therefore  necessary  to  look  directly  for  evidence  of  an  increase  in  the  
quantity of human capital at the time of the industrial revolution. For England, it is  
possible in Figure 7 to track developments in literacy, as measured by the proportion  
of the population who could sign their names.  For the period after 1750, Schofield  
(1973)  presents  data  on  the  proportion  of  males  and  females  who  couldsign  their  
names  at  marriage,  while  for  the  period  before  1750  Houstan  (1982)  tracks  the  
proportion of those able to sign court depositions in northern England. For males, the  
big  rise  in  literacy  occurred  during  the  seventeenth  century,  followed  by  a  pause  
during  the  industrial  revolution  period,  before  the  drive  to more  or  less  universal  
literacy during the second half of the nineteenth century. For females, the data suggest  
a more or less continuous rise in literacy from a very low level in the mid-seventeenth  
century.  The  English  case  thus  offers little  support  for  viewing  the  industrial  
revolution as uniquely linked to developments in human capital. 
Turning  to  the  literacy  data  for  a  wider  sample  of  largely  west  European  
countries circa 1800 in Table 6, however, notice again the Little Divergence pattern,  
with high levels of literacy in northwest Europe covering England and Scotland, the  
Netherlands and  belgium,  Germany  west  of  the  Stralsund-Dresden  line and France  
north of the Geneva-St. Malo line. In most of these regions, already 60 to 80 per cent  
of the male population and over 40 per cent of the female population were literate. In  
more peripheral regions, literacy rates were much lower, between 10 and 45 per cent  
for males and 10 to 20 per cent for females (Reis, 2005). 

========22========

22 
The relationship between real wages, population and human capital during the  
transition  to  modern  economic  growth  is  thus  more  complex  than  suggested  by  
unified growth theory. First, there is evidence that the European economy had ceased  
to behave in a Malthusian fashionlong before the industrial revolution. Although the  
persistence of a high real wage in England is associated with a slow recovery of the  
population to pre-Black Death levels, Belgium and the Netherlands maintained a high  
real wage despite a rapid recovery of population. Second, although the incentive to  
invest  in  human  capital  was  higher  in  the  medieval  period,  there  was  a  substantial  
increase  in  literacy  in  northwest  Europe  during  the  early  modern  period. Third,  
however,  the  industrial  revolution  appears  to  have  coincided  with  a  pause  in  this  
process of human capital deepening. 
2. Institutions, markets and technology 
Kindleberger (1996) and Maddison (2001) are the latest in a long line of economic  
historians  to  chart  the  rise  to  modern  economic  growth  in  the  west  as  a  series  of  
growth episodes based around success in long distance trade. Economic  primacy is  
seen as passing from the Italian city states before 1500 to Portugal and Spain in the  
sixteenth  century,  then  to  the  Low  Countries  in  the  seventeenth  century  before  the  
industrial revolution led to the primacy  of  Britain from the late eighteenth century.  
This  approach  normally  goes  hand  in  hand  with  a  stress  on  institutions.  As  in  the  
theoretical section, it is useful to begin the survey of historical work in this area with  
private order institutions.  

========23========

23 
Many writers have pointed to the importance of financial and commercial  
innovations in underpinning the success of the leading economies. Many of the key  
commercial institutionsof the western world can be seen as havingtheir origins in the 
Italian city states of Venice and Florence, which played such an important role in the  
revival of long distance trade between Europe and the East from the eleventh century.  
Deposit banking grew out of money changing, while insurance, the legal form of he  
modern company and double entry book-keeping all grew up around shipping  
ventures (Lane, 1966; Mueller, 1997). Similarly, early modern Amsterdam is credited  
by Neal (1990) with a number of commercial innovations including the bill of  
exchange, transferable shares in the capital stock of corporations traded on secondary  
markets and perpetual annuities issued annually by government, free of risk of default  
(consolidated debt or consols).  
Any claim to be the originator of any such practices is always open to  
challenge, however. Hence another important strand in the literature which traces the  
origins of western economic success to institutional developments is the emphasis on  
the growing commercialisation of the economy (Britnell and Campbell, 1995). The  
growing commercialisation of the European economy can most easily be captured  
quantitatively in the share of the population living in urban areas, since towns were  
the centres of commerce. Table 7 provides data on the share of the population living  
in towns of at least 10,000 inhabitants. For Europe as a whole, the trend is  
unmistakeably upwards from 1400. Looking at regional trends, however, urbanisation  
is another variable which displays the Little Divergence pattern. In the late medieval  
period there were two main urban centres of commerce in north Italy and in the Low  
Countries. While urbanisation stalled in north Italy after 1500, there was a brief surge  

========24========

24 
in Portugal and to a lesser extent Spain during the sixteenth century, following the  
opening up of the new trade routes to Asia and the New World. However, the most  
dramatic growth of urbanisation in the early modern period occurred in the  
Netherlands in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and in England during the  
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as those countries displaced the Iberian powers  
in long distance trade and commercialised their domestic economies to an  
unprecedented extent.  
The  extent  of  commercialisation  and  the  spread  of  specialisation  which  
accompanied it can also be captured in Table 8 by the declining share of the labour  
force engaged in agriculture. The link between commercialisation and the share of the  
labour  force  in  agriculture  is  at  least  implicit  in  the  historical  literature  on  proto- 
industrialisation following the work of Mendels (1972), who saw commercialisation  
leading  to  the  development  of  industry  in  the  countryside  before  the  industrial  
revolution.  It  is  also  implicit  in  the  work  of  Brenner  (1982),  who  emphasises  the  
contrast between England, where the peasantry was replaced by tenants and labourers  
who  had  to  compete  in  the  market,  and  the  continent  where  peasants  were  able  to  
cling to the land and preserve feudal property rights. By 1600, the release of labour  
from agriculture had proceeded further in the Netherlands than in the rest of Europe,  
as  the  Dutch  economy  relied  increasingly  on  imports  of  basic  agricultural  products  
such as grain and paid for them with exports of higher value added products (de Vries  
and  van  der  Woude,  1997).  By  1700,  the  share  of  the  labour  force  engaged  in  
agriculture was even smaller in England, where a highly commercialised agriculture  
produced enough grain to feed the population without recourse to substantial imports  

========25========

25 
(Deane  and  Cole,  1967;  Crafts,  1985). The  share  of  the  labour  force in  agriculture  
remained substantially higher  in the rest of Europe.  
Another strand of the literature which seeks to apply the insights of the new  
institutional economics to history emphasises the role of state institutions. For North  
and Weingast (1989), the Glorious Revolution is important in creating the climate for  
the  transition  to  modern  economic  growth,  by  limiting  the  power  of  the  crown  to  
interfere in economic activity, thus solving the “fundamental problem of exchange”.  
A similar argument can be made for the Dutch Revolt of the late sixteenth century,  
which overthrew the system of Spanish rule and established constraints on the abuse  
of executive power. The argument has been generalised by Acemoglu, Johnson and  
Robinson (2005), who emphasise the interaction between access to the Atlantic and  
constraints on executive power. They point out that the opening up of the new trade  
routes after 1500 did not benefit all economies with access to the Atlantic equally. In  
the countries which gained most (Britain andthe Netherlands), there were sufficient  
constraints on the rulersto endure that they were unable to appropriate the bulk of the  
gains from trade. By contrast, in the Atlantic economies which failed most obviously  
to gain from the new opportunities, despite their early role in the discovery of the new  
trade  routes  (Spain  and  Portugal),  rulers  were  sufficiently  strong  to  exploit  the  
opportunities themselves and prevent a strong merchant class from constraining their  
powers to appropriate. 
As Mokyr (2008) notes, the literature on institutions has tended to say very  
little about the central feature of the industrial revolution, the dramatic technological  
change which occurred in Britain in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.  

========26========

26 
One obvious institutional change which could provide such a link is the patent system,  
which until very recently has received surprisingly little attention in mainstream  
economic history. The modern literature really began with the study of the English  
patent system during the industrial revolution by Dutton (1984) and Sullivan (1989),  
who highlighted the surge in patents from the middle of the eighteenth century, shown  
here in Figure 8, and saw it as a causal factor. MacLeod (1988) examined the  
evolution of the system from the mid-seventeenth to the end of the eighteenth century,  
but emphasised its shortcomings as much as its advantages. However, there is a world  
of difference between saying that the patent systemwas not as good as it would later  
become, and dismissing itsimportance at the time.  
More  recently,  the  importance  of  the  role  of  the  patent  system  in  the  
acceleration  of  British  economic  growth  has  been  emphasised  by  Broadberry  and  
Gupta  (2009) in  the  context  of  cotton  textiles,  where  there  was  a  dramatic  shift  of  
competitive  advantage  between  Britain  and  India.  Broadberry  and  Gupta  (2009)  
emphasise the interaction between the large Anglo-Indian wage gap noted earlier and  
the  institutional  feature  of  the  British  patent  system. High  money  wages  in  Britain  
meant  that  cotton  textiles  produced  domestically  with  labour-intensive  production  
methods could not compete with Indian goods in third markets, and could only be sold  
domestically because of protective measures that remained in force between 1701 and 
1774  (Inikori, 2002:  428-432;  O‟Brien  et  al., 1991).  This  stimulated  a  two-stage  
process  of  technological  change.  First,  high  wages  led  to  the  adoption  of  a  more  
capital  intensive  technology  in  Britain,  characterised  by  the  use  of  labour-saving  
machinery in factories. Second, this resulted in a faster rate of productivity growth in  
Britain, because of the greater incentive to devote resources to improving technology  

========27========

27 
where  capital  intensity  is  higher.  This  is  consistent  with  the  positive  relationship  
between capital intensity, resources devoted to research and development, and the rate  
of  technological  progress,  highlighted  in  Schumpeterian  models  of  growth  (Aghion  
and  Howitt,  1998).  This  effect  can  be  explained  partly  by  the  greater  learning  
potential on capital intensivetechnology, as suggested by Arrow (1962), but in Britain  
the effect was amplified by the existence of an effective patent system.  
Note,  however,  that  the  argument is  contingent  on  particular  historical  
circumstances surroundingeconomic relations between Britain and India. The process  
of  import  substitution  was  started  by  the  popularity  of  cotton  cloth  imported  into  
Britain and the opportunity given to the early British cotton industry by the protective  
Calico  Acts  in  force  between  1701  and  1774 (Berg,  2002;  Inikori,  2002:  428-432;  
O‟Brien  et  al., 1991).  As  productivity  increased  in  the  machine-intensive  British  
cotton  textile  industry  and  stagnated  in  India,  a  shift  in  competitive  advantage  
occurred.  However,  the  shift  in  competitive  advantage  was  delayed  in  international  
markets during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries by a temporary rise  
in raw cotton prices in Britain, as the increase in production put pressure on factor  
markets.  The  shift  in  competitiveness  in  the  Indian  market  was  delayed  further  by  
transport costs, which prevented the British from breaking into the Indian market on a  
large scale until after 1830 (Ellison, 1886: 63; Twomey, 1983).  
Now  consider  the  implications  of  this  approach  for  the  question  of  why  the  
key  technological  breakthroughs  in  cotton  textiles  occurred  first  in  Britain.  When  
Crafts (1977) posed this question, the obvious comparator country was France, which  
was  being  portrayed  in  revisionist  work  as  having  similar  development  potential  

========28========

28 
(O‟Brien  and  Keyder,  1978).  However,  the  revisionism  now  seems  to  have  been  
overdone, and in the recent literature on comparative levels of development, France  
emerges as a relatively low-wage economy in the eighteenth century (Allen, 2001).  
The other high-wage European economy was the Dutch Republic, and it is therefore  
interesting now to restate the question posed by Crafts (1977) as “Why Britain, not  
Holland?”  rather  than  “Why  Britain,  not  France?”  The  answer  offered  here  is  that  
while  Holland  had  high  wages  like  Britain, it  lacked  the  large  market  to  provide  
sufficient rewards for innovation. And while France had a large population to provide  
a large market, it lacked the high wages to stimulate the adoption of machine intensive  
technology which underpinned the process of technological change that occurred in  
Britain. 
IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS: COMBINING HISTORY AND THEORY 
In  the  introduction,  I  cited  the  comments  of  Schumpeter  (1954)on  the  difficulties  
created by the existence of historical and theoretical temperaments. In this concluding  
section,  I  explore  some  of  the  implications  of  these  difficulties,  drawing  on  the  
examples of the previous sections. First, note that the unit of analysis is often quite  
different  in  the  theoretical  and  historical  literatures.  Unified  growth  theory,  in  
particular, seems to work best at the level of world development.  Indeed, the basic  
Galor and Weil (2000) model works in terms of a single closed economy. Later work  
by  Galor  and  Mountford  (2007)  does  explore  the  Great  Divergence  within  a  two- 
country model, but in a highly stylised way. Where country-specific data are used in  
Galor (2005), they are typically used for particular episodes and are presented only as  
suggestive evidence. Historians tend  to  worry  much  more  systematically  about  the  
cross-sectional  variation  between  countries and  how  it  evolves  over  time,  taking  

========29========

29 
delight  in  those  details  of  the  historical  process  referred  to  in  the  quote  from  
Schumpeter (1954: 815) at the beginning of the paper. Historians need to be able to  
explain the Little Divergence and the differences between Britain and Holland, as well  
as the Great Divergence.For them, the cross-sectional variation is a crucial part of the  
story and models must be flexible enough to deal with it in a convincing way and not  
just as an ad hoc afterthought. 
A  second  issue  concerns  the  role  of  historical  contingency.  Again,  unified  
growth theorists seem content to treat the industrial revolution as inevitable, with the  
general framework set up to deliver the transition to modern economic growth and the  
specifics of the model affecting only the timing. For historians, historical contingency  
plays  a  more  central  role,  and  things  could  easily  have  turned  out  differently.  This  
point was emphasised by Crafts (1977), who questioned the assumption that because  
the first industrial revolution occurred first in Britainex post, it must have been more  
likely there ex ante. The importance of historical contingency has since become firmly  
entrenched  in  the  historical  literature  via  the  idea  of  path  dependence,  with  the  
sequence of events affecting the final outcome, not just the path taken (David, 1985,  
Arthur, 1989). 
The  recent  historical  and  theoretical  literatures  therefore  share  a  common  
purpose in breaking away from the traditional practiceof using different methods to  
analyse the world before and  after the industrial revolution. However, there  remain  
important differences. From the point of view of an economic historian, it is important  
that the theoretical framework should remain flexibleenough to deal with the cross- 
sectional variation and leave room for historical contingency.
