Abstract 
Bank crises, by interrupting liquidity provision, have been viewed as resulting in welfare losses. In a model of banking with moral hazard, we show that second best bank contracts that improve on autarky ex ante require costly crises to occur with positive probability at the interim stage. When bank payo¤s are partially appropriable, either directly via imposition of –nes or indirectly by the use of bank equity as a collateral, we argue that an appropriately designed ex-ante regime of policy intervention involving conditional monitoring can prevent bank crises.

1 Introduction 
A key issue in the theoretical literature on banking is the link between illiquid assets, liquid liabilities and bank crises. In the seminal paper by Diamond and Dybvig (1983) (see also Bryant (1980)), e¢ cient risk-sharing between deposi- tors with idiosyncratic, privately observed taste shocks creates a demand for liquidity. Banks invest in illiquid assets but take on liquid liabilities by issu- ing demand deposit contracts with a sequential service constraint. Although demand deposit contracts support e¢ cient risk-sharing between depositors, the use of such contracts makes banks vulnerable to runs driven by depositor co- ordination failure. Allen and Gale (2000) extend the analysis of Diamond and Dybvig (1983) to study –nancial contagion in an optimal contracting scenario. 
However, as Diamond and Dybvig point out, when aggregate taste shocks are common knowledge, a demand deposit contract with an appropriately chosen threshold for suspension of convertibility eliminates bank runs while supporting e¢ cient risk-sharing. This point applies to the model of –nancial contagion developed by Allen and Gale (2000) as well. 
Taken together, these two remarks raise the following question: what pre- vents banks from using such contracts to rule out bank runs driven by co- ordination failure? In this paper we study a model of banking with ex ante moral hazard where there is a misalignment of incentives between banks and depositors, banks™investment decisions aren™t veri–able by depositors and bank payo¤s aren™t contractible. Under these conditions, we argue that depositors will no longer deposit their endowments with banks with zero crises probabil- ity: we show, in a second-best scenario, that both equilibrium bank runs and equilibrium contagion occur with positive probability in any banking contract that improves on autarky ex ante. 
Initially, we study banking in a closed region. Although the bank has no in- vestment funds of its own, it has a comparative advantage in operating illiquid assets: no other agent in the economy has the human capital to operate illiquid assets. Consequently, the bank controls any investment made in illiquid assets. The bank has a choice of two illiquid assets to invest in. After depositors en- dowments have been mobilized, but before the realization of idiosyncratic taste shocks, the bank makes an investment decision. Each illiquid asset generates a stream of ﬁpublicﬂand ﬁprivateﬂreturns1. 
Throughout this paper, we assume that the social planner maximizes the ex-ante utility of the representative depositor2. Even with costless, perfect monitoring of the banks actions, we show that using transfers to provide the bank with appropriate incentives can result in narrow banking and no liquidity provision. More generally, incentive compatible transfers to the bank will lower 
1Following Hart and Moore (1998), we think of "public" returns, in contract to "private returns, as cash ⁄ows generated by the asset that the bank cannot steal because they are publicly veri–able (for instance, they are embedded in physical capital which can be seized by depositors). 
2Equivalently, we assume that the depositors have all the bargaining power. In our model, scenarios where the bank has all the bargaining power always results in narrow banking.

consumption for all types of depositors. Nevertheless, our –rst result shows that it is still possible to implement e¢ cient risk sharing between depositors, without sacri–cing consumption, by using a contract which embodies the threat of a bank run o¤ the equilibrium path of play. 
In contrast, when the investment decision of the bank is non-contractible, we show that e¢ cient risk-sharing between depositors is no longer implementable. The positive probability of an equilibrium bank run is necessary and su¢ cient to resolve incentive problems in banking. Although the second-best incentive compatible contract improves on autarky (so that ex-ante forward looking de- positors will choose to deposit with the bank), it also generates, endogenously, the risk of a banking crisis. 
Next, we extend the model to multiple regions linked by an inter-bank market along the lines of Allen and Gale (2000). In this case, with local moral hazard where only the incentive constraint of the bank in one region binds, there is trade in the inter-bank market even allowing for the possibility of bank runs and contagion after the realization of liquidity shocks. Moreover, the second- best allocation is implemented by combination of trade in the inter-bank market with bank runs in region with local hazard but also, under certain parameter con–gurations, global contagion induced by the random second-best banking contract. 
In either case, the randomness introduced by banking contracts studied here is uncorrelated with fundamentals and is driven purely by incentives. We be- lieve this is a more primitive explanation for bank runs and contagion. In the formal model studied here, bailouts are equivalent to building in a suspension of convertibility clause in the banking contract. In this sense, the random second- best contracts studied here provides a rationale for the doctrine of "creative ambiguity" when the banking regulator makes no ex-ante commitment to a par- ticular bailout policy but instead leaves the banking sector in doubt about its intentions (Goodhart (1999), Russel (2009)). 
Are there policy interventions that can improve on random banking con- tracts? Intervention by central banks or government agents takes place typi- cally after the onset of a crisis. Can an ex-ante intervention be designed where monitoring and the threat of termination and /or con–scation of bank payo¤s conditional on a bank run can prevent bank runs ex-ante? A key assump- tion of our formal analysis is that once the investment decision by a bank has been made, the bank cannot be prevented from accessing its "private" non- contractible payo¤s. When this assumption is partially relaxed (for example, requiring bank payo¤s to directly accrue to an escrow account that can be ac- cessed by a regulator or the use of bank equity as a collateral), other intervention options become available. In the –nal section of the paper, we outline a policy of intervention involving (a) depositor protection via emergency liquidity provi- sion and (b) conditional monitoring and the threat of con–scation of partially appropriable bank payo¤s, either directly via imposition of –nes or indirectly by the use of bank equity as a collateral. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The remainder of the in- troduction relates the results obtained here with other papers on bank runs.

Section 2 studies a simple model of banking with moral hazard and leads up to the main result of the paper. Section 3 is devoted to contagion issues. Section 4 outlines the our policy proposal. The –nal section concludes. 
1.1 Related literature 
Although to the best of our knowledge, both the model and the results of our paper are new, in what follows, we situate our analysis in the context of related work. 
Perhaps the paper closest to the approach we adopt here is Diamond and Rajan (2001) who show that the threat of bank runs o¤ the equilibrium path of play impacts on the bank™s ability and incentives to renegotiate loan contracts with borrowers. We obtain a similar result: the threat of bank runs o¤ the equilibrium path of play (when monitoring is both costless and perfect) impacts on the investment decision of the bank. However, they do not obtain equilibrium bank runs as, in their model, whether or not banks renegotiate is observable (though not veri–able and therefore, non-contractible ex-ante). 
Calomiris and Kahn (1991) study a model of embezzlement in banking where the bank™s temptation to embezzle depends on the realization of an exogenous move of nature and depending on the prevailing state, either the bank will never be tempted to embezzle or will always be tempted to embezzle. Therefore, in Calomiris and Kahn (1991), the positive probability of a bank run relies on the existence of aggregate payo¤-relevant uncertainty. Diamond and Rajan (2000), in a framework similar to Diamond and Rajan (2001), also require the additional feature of exogenous uncertainty to obtain equilibrium bank runs. In contrast, in our paper the existence of equilibrium bank runs doesn™t rely on aggregate payo¤ relevant uncertainty. Here bank runs are driven purely by incentives. 
Holmström and Tirole ((1997), (1998)), study a model where conditional on the realization of an exogenous liquidity shock, banks incentives have to be aligned with those of the depositors. In their model, ex-ante (before the realization of the exogenous liquidity shock), the threshold (in the space of liquidity shocks) below which the bank is liquidated is set. They show that this threshold will be higher than the –rst-best threshold when agency costs are taken into account. In this sense, their ine¢ cient termination (relative to the –rst-best) is driven by exogenous payo¤-relevant uncertainty while in our paper ine¢ cient termination doesn™t require exogenous payo¤-relevant uncertainty. 
It is worth remarking that a common feature of Calomiris and Kahn (1991), Holmström and Tirole ((1997), (1998)), and Diamond and Rajan (2001), is their focus on issues of moral hazard that arise conditional on the realization of the liquidity shock. In contrast, here, we study moral hazard issues that arise ex ante before the realization of the liquidity shock. 
A related branch has focused on the relation between incomplete informa- tion about the distribution of taste shocks across depositors and bank runs in banking scenarios with a –nite number of depositors. Under the assumption that the social planner can condition allocations on the position a depositor has in the queue of depositors attempting to withdraw their deposits, Green and 
4 

========5========

Lin (2003), building on Wallace ((1998), (1990)), show that it is possible to implement the –rst-best socially optimal risk-sharing allocation without bank runs. On the other hand, by imposing further restrictions on banking contracts, Peck and Shell (2003) obtain equilibrium bank runs as a feature of the optimal banking contract. 
Another branch of the literature has focused on the relation between incom- plete information about the future returns of the illiquid asset and bank runs (see, for instance, Gorton (1985), Gorton and Pennacchi (1990), Postlewaite and Vives (1987), Chari and Jaganathan (1988), Jacklin and Bhattacharya (1988), Allen and Gale (1998)). However, in these papers, the variation in the future re- turns of the illiquid asset is exogenous while here the variation in future returns is a function of the investment decision of the bank and is hence endogenous. 
Finally, in our paper, as in Aghion and Bolton (1992), bank runs can be interpreted as a way of allocating control of over banking assets to depositors. However, unlike Aghion and Bolton (1992), the reallocation of control rights isn™t triggered by some exogenous event but endogenously via depositor™s actions in the second-best banking contract. 
2 Bank runs with moral hazard 
2.1 The model 
In this section we study a model of banking in a closed region. The model extends Diamond-Dybvig (1983) to allow for moral hazard in banking. There are three time periods, t = 0;1;2. In each period there is a single perishable good xt. There is a continuum of identical depositors in [0;1], indexed by i, of mass one, each endowed with one unit of the perishable good at time period t = 0 and nothing at t = 1 and t = 2. Each depositor has access to a storage technology that allows him to convert one unit of the consumption good invested at t = 0 to 1 unit of the consumption good at t = 1 or to 1 unit of the consumption good at t = 2. 
Depositors preferences over consumption are identical ex-ante i.e. as of pe- riod 0. Each faces a privately observed uninsurable risk of being type 1 or type 2. In period 1, each consumer learns of his type. Type 1 agents care only about consumption in period 1 while for type 2 agents, consumption in period 1 and consumption in period 2 are perfect substitutes. For each agent, only to- tal consumption (and not its period-wise decomposition) is publicly observable. Formally, at t = 1; each agent has a state dependent utility function which has the following form: 
ˆ 
U(x1; x2; ) = 
u(x1) if i is of type 1 in state  
u(x1 + x2) if i is of type 2 in state  
In each state of nature, there is a proportion  of the continuum of agents who are of type 1 and conditional on the state of nature, each agent has an equal and independent chance of being type 1. It is assumed that  is commonly known. 
5 

========6========

In addition, there is a bank, denoted by b. The bank™s preferences over consumption is represented by the linear utility function Ub(x0; x1; x2) = x1 +3 
x2 . Unlike depositors, the bank has no endowments of the consumption good at t = 0. However, the bank is endowed with two di¤erent asset technologies, j = A; B, that convert inputs of the perishable good at t = 0 to outputs of the perishable consumption good at t = 1 or t = 2. We will assume that the size of the bank is large relative to the size of an individual depositor4. As each individual depositor has a (Lebesgue) measure zero, if the bank has the same size as an individual depositor, transfers to the bank can be made without a¤ecting the overall resource constraint. In order to capture the trade-o¤ between making transfers to the bank and e¢ cient risk sharing between depositors, the bank has to be large relative to the depositors. 
The output of the perishable consumption good produced by either asset technology has two components: a ﬁprivateﬂ non-contractible component that only the bank can access and consume and a ﬁpublicﬂ component which de- positors can access and consume as well. Both the ﬁpublicﬂ and the ﬁprivateﬂ component of both asset technologies are characterized by constant returns to scale. For each unit of the consumption good invested in t = 0, asset technology j, j = A; B, yields either 1 unit of the ﬁpublicﬂcomponent of the consumption good if the project is terminated at t = 1 or Rj > 0 units of the ﬁpublicﬂcom- ponent of the consumption good at t = 2 if the project continues to t = 2. In addition, for each unit of the consumption good invested in t = 0, asset tech- nology j, j = A; B, yields rbj unit of the ﬁprivateﬂnon-contractible component of the consumption good if the project is terminated at t = 1, or Rbj > 0 units of the ﬁprivateﬂ component of the consumption good at t = 2 if the project continues to t = 25. In addition, at t = 0, the bank incurs a direct private utility cost cj per unit of the consumption good invested in asset j at t = 0. 
In order to operate either of these two asset technologies, the bank has to mobilize the endowments of the depositors. At t = 0, we assume that mobilizing depositors™endowments requires a banking contract which speci–es an allocation for each type of depositor and an investment portfolio for the bank. 
Any contract used must satisfy the following constraints: 
(a) the bank controls any investment that is made into either of these two asset technologies and the operation of both these two asset technologies, 
(b) no other agent in the economy has the human capital to operate either of these two technologies, 
(c) no other agent can replace the bank to take over the operation of either 
3The assumption that 
ub (:) is linear simpli–es the computations and the notation consid- erably. All the results stated here extend, with appropiately modi–ed computations, to the case where ub (:) is strictly increasing and concave in consumption. 
4Technically, the set of agents is modelled as a mixed measure space where each individual depositor has a Lebesgue measure zero (and therefore is part of an atomless continuum of depositors) while the bank is an atom with measure one. For details on how construct such a measure space see Busetto, Codognato and Ghosal (2010). 
5The assumption that within a technology there is no choice as to how much of the in- vestment goes into the public component and how much into the private component is a simpli–cation and nothing essential in our results depends on this analysis.

illiquid asset from the bank at t = 1, 
(d) at t = 1 verifying or observing the investment decision of the bank, made at t = 0, is possible only if an appropriate monitoring technology is available, 
(e) the public return at t = 1 is observed by the depositors and/or an outside agent (a court) only if the asset technology is terminated at t = 1 and the public return at t = 2 is observed by the depositors and/or the outside agent only at t = 2. 
The consequence of making these assumptions is that, in the absence of a perfect monitoring technology, the investment decision of the bank at t = 0 is non-contractible. The combination of non-contractible actions together with the "private" non-contractible component of bank payo¤s is the source of the moral hazard problem. 
In addition, we make some further assumptions on depositor™s preferences and the two asset technologies: 
(A1) u(:) is strictly increasing, strictly concave, smooth utility function, 
(A2)  
u00(x)x 
u0(x) 
> 1 for all x > 0, 
(A3) RA > 1 > RB > 0,b

A 
> RB + 
(A5) maxrbA; rb 
	 
RbB, 
B 
< Rbj, j = A; B, 
(A6) cA > cB 
Assumption (A1) implies that each individual type 1 and type 2 depositor is risk-averse. Assumption (A2) implies that whenever there is e¢ cient risk- sharing, the bank has to provide liquidity services: narrow banking is ruled out. Under assumption (A3), it can never be in the depositor™s interest for the bank to invest in asset B: depositors will prefer to invest their endowments of the consumption good in the storage technology. Assumption (A4) implies that production e¢ ciency requires investment in asset A. Assumption (A5) implies that for either asset, the bank prefers the project to continue to t = 2. Assumption (A6) says that it is costlier for the bank to operate the asset A the e¢ cient asset technology. 
An allocation is a vector (  
b) 
s; ; x; x 
where (  
s; ) 
is the asset (equiva- lently, investment) portfolio (chosen at t = 0) and describes the proportion of endowments invested in the storage technology and asset technology A (with proportion 1   
s 
  invested in asset technology B), x = (x11; x21; x12; x22) is the consumption allocation of the depositors (xkt is the consumption of type k depositor in time period t, k = 1;2 and t = 1;2) and describes what each type of 
depositor consumes in each period and xb = 
 
xb1; xb2 describes the consumption allocation to the bank. A consequence of assumptions (A4) and (A5) is that productive e¢ ciency, and hence ex ante e¢ ciency, requires that  = 1. 
Throughout the paper we that the social planner maximizes the ex ante utility of a representative depositor6. We –rst characterize the (constrained) e¢ cient allocation and then, examine the implementation of this allocation us- ing contracts (games). Given the sequential structure of the banking scenario 
6It can be easily veri–ed (details available on request) that when banks have all the bar- gaining power, narrow banking results. 
7 

========8========

studied here, our notion of implementation requires that agents use dominant actions in every subgame of the banking contract. 
2.2 Contracts without bank runs 
Clearly, the ex-ante utility of the representative depositor is 
g(x) = u(x11) + (1 
 )u(x21 + x22) 
where g(x) is a weighted sum of type 1 and type 2 depositors preferences where the weights used re⁄ect the aggregate proportions of type 1 and type 2 de- positors. When there is no monitoring technology available, the representative depositor cannot condition transfers to the bank at t = 1 or t = 2, on the in- vestment portfolio chosen by the bank at t = 0. In this case, making transfers to the bank will have no impact on the bank™s incentives. Without a moni- toring technology, in any banking contract that maximizes the ex ante utility of the representative depositor, no transfers, over and above the private non- contractible payo¤ the bank receives by operating either asset technology, will be made to the bank. 
Consider the case when RbA  cA  RbB  cB. In this case, we claim that the social planner can design a banking contract that implements the e¢ cient risk- sharing without bank runs. The social planner solves the following maximization problem (labelled (P) for later reference): 
max g(x)f ;x;x

The solutions to (P) satisfy the equations 
(1) x21 = x12 = 0; 
(2) u0(x11 ) = RAu0(x22 ); 
(3) RA = RAx11 + (1  )x22 ; 
while for the bank 
(4a)  
 
= 1; 
(4b) xb1 = 0; 
(4c) xb2 = RbA: 
Allocations characterized by (1)  (4) correspond to the –rst-best allocations in Diamond and Dybvig (1983). As in their paper, under the assumption (A1), u00(x) < 0 while under assumption (A3), RA > 1. Therefore, using (2), it2 
follows that x 
2 
> x11 . This ensures that the truth telling constraints (P3) is satis–ed. Under the additional assumption that  
u00(x)x 
u0(x) 
> 1 it also follows that x11 > 1 while x22 < RA so that e¢ cient risk-sharing requires the bank to provide liquidity services: narrow banking is ruled out.

  
Again, as in Diamond and Dybvig (1983), there is a banking contract ; ^ r;^ k^ , satisfying a sequential service constraint and with suspension of convertibility7, that implements (  
; x). Each depositor who withdraws in period 1 obtains a –xed claim r^1 = x11 per unit deposited at t = 0 and convertibility is suspended at k^ = . If banking continues to t = 2, each agent who withdraws at t = 2, obtains a –xed claim r^2 = x22 per unit deposited at t = 0 and not withdrawn at t = 1. Moreover,  ^ = 1. The argument establishing how such a contract implements –rst-best risk sharing follows Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and is reported in appendix 1. 
What happens if RbA  cA < RbB  cB and the long-run interests of the depositors and the bank are no longer aligned? If costless and perfect monitoring of the bank™s portfolio choice, made at t = 0, is possible at t = 1, the depositor can write a banking contract that conditions transfers at t = 1 on portfolio choices made by the bank at t = 0. Whether the social planner will actually choose to do so is an issue examined in the next subsection. 
2.3 Contracts with the threat of bank runs 
In this subsection, we examine the case where at time t = 0, it becomes common knowledge that the social planner has invested in a monitoring technology and study the case of costless and perfect monitoring. With monitoring, we assume that (a) before the bank makes its investment decision, it becomes common knowledge that depositors have invested in the monitoring technology, and (b) all monitoring occurs at t = 1 after the realization of  and the results of monitoring are publicly revealed before depositors choose whether or not to withdraw their deposits. 
Speci–cally, we assume that at t = 0, it is common knowledge that at the beginning of t = 1, the social planner observes the investment allocation across assets made by the bank at t = 0. We assume that RbA  cA < RbB  cB. An obvious additional component in a banking contract is that now the social planner can commit to make transfers to the bank at t = 2, contingent on the actions chosen by the bank at t = 0. Note that under our assumptions, the social planner cannot make negative transfers to the bank i.e. –ne the bank. This is because, by assumption, the payo¤s of the bank are private and non- contractible. Therefore, any transfer made to the bank has to be non-negative. 
Suppose the social planner commits to make a transfer, at t = 2, to the bank of ˝b2 (  ), such that RbA + ˝b2 (1)  cA = RbB  cB + ", where " > 0 but in–nitesimal, while ˝b2 (  ) = 0 for all  = 1. In this case, the bank will choose 6 
7The sequential service constraint implies that (a) withdrawal tenders are served sequen- tially in random order until the bank runs out of assets and (b) the bank™s payo¤ to any agent can depend only on the agent™s place in the line and not on any future information about agents behind him in the line while suspension of convertibility implies that any agent attempting to withdraw at t = 1 will receive nothing at t = 1 if he attempts to withdraw at t = 1 after a fraction k^ of depositors. Note that along the equilibrium path of play, neither the sequential service constraint nor the suspension of convertibility constraint ever binds in any of the banking contracts, whether random or deterministic, studied in this paper.

The above example shows that with transfers, even with costless and perfect monitoring, there is, in general, a trade-o¤ between (a) e¢ cient risk-sharing between type 1 and type 2 depositors and provision of liquidity, and (b) provid- ing the bank with appropriate incentives. In robust banking scenarios, banking contracts with transfers results in no risk-sharing between type 1 and type 2 depositors and consequently, no provision of liquidity i.e. in narrow banking. 
In general, however, even if risk-sharing between type 1 and type 2 depositors and providing the bank with appropriate incentives are consistent i.e. if there is a solution satisfying (1), (2), (P01) and (5), incentive compatible transfers to the bank will lower consumption for both types of depositors. To make this point, observe that when equations (1) and (2) are satis–ed, we have that

which implies that as RA > 1 and u00(:) < 0, x022 > x011 , x022 < f (1) and therefore, x011 > 1. But we also have that x011 < x11 and x022 < x22 . It follows that if (6) holds, any solution can be implemented by an appropriately designed banking contract, augmented with transfers and with suspension of convertibility. How- ever, such an contract will inevitably entail a consumption loss for both types of depositors. 
Assuming that the action chosen by the bank, at t = 0 can be observed costlessly at t = 1, can the social planner design a banking contract without transfers that implements the allocation x? 
The following argument shows that this is indeed possible. The main idea of the argument is that the social planner can observe  , and therefore make the terms of the banking contract contingent on  so that if  = 1, there is no bank run while if  < 1, there is a bank run (equivalently, asset liquidation) with probability one. Such a banking contract would induce the bank to choose  = 1 at t = 0. Therefore, in the game induced by the banking contract, although bank runs are never observed along the equilibrium path of play, the threat of a bank run o¤ the equilibrium path of play induces the bank to choose  = 1 along the equilibrium path of play. 
The details are as follows. Let r0 (  ) be a function de–ned from [0;1] to <2+ while let k0 (  ) be a function de–ned from [0;1] to itself. Consider the banking contract, subject to a sequential service constraint, described by a vector (  
0; r0; k0) 
such that r0 (1) = x1 
1 
per unit deposited at t = 0, r01 
1 
(  ) = 1 for  < 1, k0 (1) =  while k0 (  ) = 1 for  < 1, and if banking continues to t = 2, r02 (1) = x22 while for  < 1, r02 (  ) = 0 per unit deposited at t = 0 and not withdrawn at t = 1. The contract also speci–es the bank™s asset portfolio where  
0 
= 1. It follows that when  = 1, it is a dominant action for type one depositors to withdraw and for type two depositors not to withdraw at t = 1, while it is a dominant action for all types of depositors to withdraw their deposits at t = 1 whenever  < 1. Anticipating this behavior by depositors, the bank will choose  =  
0 
= 1 as this yields a payo¤ RbA  cA while choosing  < 1 yields a payo¤

We summarize the above discussion as the following proposition: 
Proposition 1 When costless and perfect monitoring8 is possible, a banking contract with the threat of bank runs o¤ the equilibrium path of play can im- plement the e¢ cient allocation x and yield the depositor higher payo¤s than a banking contract involving transfers to the bank. 
2.4 Contracts with equilibrium bank runs 
What happens if RbA  cA < RbB  cB and there is no available monitoring technology for verifying and observing the investment decision of the bank at t = 1? In this case, allowing for transfers to the bank will have no impact on the bank™s incentives. A banking contract, all of whose Nash equilibria at 
8The case of imperfect and costly monitoring combines features of the results obtained in this section and section 2.4 below and is studied in section 4 below.

t = 1 involve a zero probability of a bank run, will fail to implement any  > 0. If rbA  cA < rbB  cB, even when bank runs occur with probability one, the bank will not invest in asset A: in this case without establishing some sort of contractibility over bank payo¤s, no depositor will invest with the bank and even the second-best e¢ ciency cannot be achieved. 
Assume that rbA  cA > rbB  cB9 and if there is enough chance of a bank run (equivalently, early asset liquidation)10 at t = 1, so that technology A gets to generate a higher "private" utility to the bank than technology B, one might get the bank to invest all available resources at t = 0 in asset technology A. So a run is clearly necessary to implement any allocation with  > 0. That it is su¢ cient is proved below. However requiring  > 0 entails a positive probability of a bank run at t = 1 and although e¢ cient risk-sharing between type 1 and type 2 depositors is never implemented with probability one, it is achieved with strictly positive probability. 
Consider the randomization scheme (S; ˇ) where S = fs1; :::; sMg, M  2, is some arbitrary but –nite set of states of nature andP ˇ = fˇ1; :::; ˇMg,m=M 
ˇm  0, 
m=1 
ˇm = 1 is a probability distribution over S11. The ran- domization scheme works as follows: at t = 0, no agent, including the bank, observes sm while at t = 1, before any choices are made, the realized value of sm is revealed to all depositors but not the bank and as before, each de- 
positor privately observes her own type. A random allocation is a collec- tion

and let ˇ = ˇm. The interpretation is that whenever sm 2 S, the asset 
m2M 
needs to be liquidated at t = 1 and therefore, ˇ is the probability of a bank run. Therefore, at t = 1, both the bank and the depositors can condition any choices they make on sm.

9One interpretation of the payo¤ inequalities studied in this part of the paper, consistent with Hart and Moore, is as follows. Assume that the "private" payo¤ of the bank has two components: (i) a –xed fraction rbA (respectively, rbB) of the public return generated by the asset A (respectively, asset B) and obtained by the bank upon termination in either period, and (ii) cash ⁄ows generated by the asset which can be stolen (because they cannot be accessed by the social planner or depositors) by the bank which is normalised to zero for both asset A and asset B if termination occurs at t = 1 but a positive quantity  (respectively, zero) 
for asset B (respectively, asset A) if termination occurs at t = 2. As cA > cB, the inequalityb 
r  cA > rbB  cB implies that rbA > rb rB 
b 
< rA 
b 
< RA 
bB. In e¤ect we are assuming that 
A 
= rbARA < RbB = rbBRB +  . Speci–cally, we assume that the cash ⁄ow that the bank can steal before termination occurs in t = 2 is big enough i.e  > rbARA  rbBRB. When the bank invests in asset technology B, a bank run prevents it from accessing  . 
10By assumption, no other agent can replace the bank to take over the operation of either illiquid asset from the bank at t = 1 which, in turn, implies that the second-best banking contract studied below is renegotiation proof. 
11Obviously, there are other ways of introducing randomness in the social planner™s problem. We choose the randomization scheme presented here as a matter of convenience.

and therefore, there exists a unique threshold ˇ~, 0 < ˇ <~ 1, such that for all ˇ > ˇ~, ˇ < 1, the moral hazard constraint ( P~5) holds as a strict inequality for

By construction,

and as u0(:) > 0, using (P~3) and (P~4), we obtain that 
(20b) ~x11 (sm) = ~x21 (sm); sm 2 S; 
while using (30), 
(20c) ~x11 (sm) = ~x21 (sm) = 1; sm 2 S; 
as when there is a bank run, this is the only allocation consistent with the feasibility and participation constraints in P~. It follows that 
(20d) ~x21 (sm) = 0; sm 2 Sn S;

(20e) u0(~x1 (sm)) = RAu0(~x21

It follows that for a –xed pair (S; ˇ), M  2, such that S is non-empty and ˇ  ˇ~, ˇ < 1, there is a unique random allocation satisfying (10)  (40). For a –xed pair (S; ˇ), such that either S is empty or ˇ < ˇ~, we have already established that there is no allocation that satis–es (10)  (40). Finally, for a –xed pair (S; ˇ), such that either Sn S is empty or ˇ = 1, both x~11 (sm) = ~x22 (sm) = 1, x~b1 (sm) = rbA and x~b2 (sm) = 0 for all sm 2 S. In this case observe that though the moral hazard constraint (40) always holds, there is no state at which there is e¢ cient risk-sharing. 
Next, we examine the (constrained) optimal choice of the pair (S; ˇ). First note that at any optimal choice of (S; ˇ), generating a unique random allocation satisfying (10)  (40), both Sn S and S will have to be non empty. Fix a pair (S; ˇ), M  2, generating a unique random allocation satisfying (10)  (40) denoted by (~x;x~b). Then, there is a pair (S0; ˇ0), S0 = fs0 ; s0 and ˇ

It follows that without loss of generality, we can restrict attention to S0 such that M = 2. Finally, as the representative depositor wants to maximize the probability with which e¢ cient risk sharing is implemented, she will choose the lowest value of ˇ02 compatible with ( P~5) being satis–ed as a strict inequality i.e. choose ˇ02 = ~ˇ+" < 1, where " > 0 is small but strictly positive number so that (P~5) is satis–ed as a strict inequality. Setting ˇ02 = ~ˇ will imply that (P~5) will be satis–ed as an equality in which case the representative depositor will have to rely on the bank choosing a tie-breaking rule in favour of asset technology A. 
It remains to specify a random banking contract that will implement the ran- dom allocation satisfying (10)  (40). A random banking contract12 is described 
12As before we assume that at 
t = 0, no agent, including the bank, observes sm while at t = 1, before any choices are made, the realized value of sm is revealed to all agents. Thererfore, at t = 1, both the bank and the depositers can condition any choices they make on sm.

The interpretation is that subject to a sequential service constraint and suspension of convertibility, each depositor who withdraws in period 1 obtains a random claim r~1 (s0m), s0m 2 S0 per unit deposited at t = 0. If banking continues to t = 2, each agent who withdraws at t = 2, obtains a random claim r~2 (s0m), s0m 2 S0 per unit deposited at t = 0. With such a contract, given s0m 2 S0, the payo¤ to per unit of deposit withdrawn at t = 1, which depends on the fraction of deposits serviced before agent j, kj, is given by the expression 
ˆu(~r1 
v~1(fj;r~1 (s0m);k~(s0m); s0m) = 
(s0m)); if fj  k~(s0m) 
u(0); kj > k~(sm0 )

ˆu(~r2 
v~2(f;r~1 (s0m); s0m) = 
(s0m)); if 1 > k(s0m) ~r1 (s0m) 
0; otherwise 
At t = 1, for each value of s0m 2 S0, the above contract induces a noncooperative game between depositors where each depositor chooses what fraction of their 
deposits to withdraw. Fix s0m 2 S0. Suppose depositor j withdraws a fraction j (s0m) Then, a type 1 depositor obtains a payo¤j (s0m) ~v1(fj;r~1 (s0 );k~(s0

m)+ 1  j (s0m) v~2(f;r~1 (s0m); s0m). Remark that for a type 1 depositor, j (s0m) = 0 strictly dominates all other actions. For s01, as k~(s01) = , r~1 (s01) = x11 and r~2 (s01) = x22 , it follows that v~2(f;r~1 (s0 ); s0 
1 
) > v~1(fj;r~1 (s0

and for type 2 depositors, j (s01) = 0 strictly dominates all other actions. For s02, as r~1 (s02) = 1 while r~2 (s0 
0 
2) = 0, it follows that for type 2 depositors, 
j (s2) = 1 strictly dominates all other actions. Therefore, (i) for s01, the unique Nash equi- librium in strictly dominant actions is j (s01) = 1 if j is a type 1 depositor while j (s01) = 0 if j is a type 2 depositor and (ii) s02, the unique Nash equilibrium in strictly dominant actions is j (s01) = 1 for all j.

As (60) holds as a strict inequality, it follows that choosing  = ~  = 1 is the strictly dominant choice for the bank. 
The above random banking contract implements the allocation satisfying (10)  (40). 
We summarize the above discussion with the following proposition: 
Proposition 2 When RbA  cA < RbB  cB but rbA  cA > rbB  cB the second- best allocation determined by

(10)  (40) is implemented by the random banking contract S0; ˇ0; ; ~ r;~ k~ . 
15 

========16========

The above result makes clear that whenever the moral hazard constraint binds, bank runs are an endemic feature of the second-best banking contract and limits liquidity provision by banks. 
Remark: In the preceding analysis, what is critical is that the aggregate proportion  of type 1 depositors is commonly observed at t = 1. Consider a modi–cation of the problem so that the aggregate proportion  of type 1 de- positors can be any one element from a set f1; :::; Ng and at t = 0 there is a common probability distribution over f1; :::; Ng. However, at t = 1, the realized value of  is commonly observed. In such a case, the e¢ cient risk- sharing allocation will be contingent on  2 f1; :::; Ng and all the preceding results, after appropriate reformulation, continue to apply. In this sense, our results don™t require but can be extended to scenarios with exogenous uncer- tainty. With exogenous uncertainty, the class of random contracts studied here, introduce noise that is independent of fundamentals in the banking process. 
3 Local moral hazard and contagion 
3.1 The model 
In this section, we extend the model studied in section 2 to allow for multiple banks and moral hazard in banking along the lines of Allen and Gale (2000). There are three time periods, t = 0;1;2. In each period there is a single per- ishable good xt. There are two regions, n = 1;2. In each region, there is a continuum of identical depositors in [0;1], indexed by i, of mass one, each en- dowed with one unit of the perishable good at time period t = 0 and nothing at t = 1 and t = 2. Each depositor has access to a storage technology that allows him to convert one unit of the consumption good invested at t = 0 to 1 unit of the consumption good at t = 1 or to 1 unit of the consumption good at t = 2. 
Depositors preferences over consumption are as before. The main di¤erence is that now in each state of nature, there is a proportion n; of the continuum of agents in region l who are of type 1 and conditional on the state of nature, each agent has an equal and independent chance of being type 1. For simplicity, it will be assumed that there two states of the world so that  2 f1; 2g. When  = 1, in region n = 1, 1 = L while in region n = 2, 2 = H with 0 < L < H < 1. Symmetrically, when  = 2, in region n = 2, 2 = L while in region c = 1, 1 = H. It is assumed that ex-ante at t = 0, there is a prior distribution over f1; 2g given by fp;1  pg. 
In addition, in each region c, there is a bank, denoted by bn. Bank preferences over consumption is also as before. As before, neither bank has any endowments of the consumption good at t = 0 but are endowed with two di¤erent asset technologies, j = A; B, that convert inputs of the perishable good at t = 0 to outputs of the perishable consumption good at t = 1 or t = 2. As before, we will assume that the size of either bank is large relative to the size of an individual depositor. 
The asset technology is similar to the case of a monopoly bank in a closed 
16 

========17========

region. As before, there are two asset technologies. The ﬁpublicﬂreturns gener- ated by each asset is as in the case of the monopoly bank. In addition, for each unit of the consumption good invested in t = 0, asset technology j, j = A; B, yields rb 
n 
unit of the ﬁprivateﬂnon-contractible component of the consumption good if the project is terminated at t = 1, or Rb 
n 
j 
> 0 units of the ﬁprivateﬂ component of the consumption good at t = 2 if the project continues to t = 2. In addition, at t = 0, the bank incurs a direct private utility cost cj per unit of the consumption good invested in asset j at t = 0. 
As before, operating either of these two asset technologies requires each bank to mobilize the endowments of the depositors within its own region: we do not allow for the possibility that the bank in region 1 is able to mobilize the deposits of some depositors in region 2 and vice versa. 
At t = 0, we assume that mobilizing depositors™ endowments requires a banking contract in each region that speci–es an allocation for each type of depositor and an investment portfolio for the bank within that region. 
As before, the investment decision of either bank at t = 0 is non-contractible13. Further, within each region, depositor preferences and asset returns satisfy as- sumptions (A1)  (A6) above. 
An allocation is a vector (  
bn 
ns; n; xn; x 
: n = 1;2) where (  
ns; n) 
is the asset (equivalently, investment) portfolio (chosen at t = 0) and describes the proportion of endowments invested in the storage technology and asset technology A (with proportion 1   
ns 
  invested in asset technology B), xn = (x1n1; x2n1; x1n2; x2n2) is the consumption allocation of the depositors (xknt is the consumption of type k depositor in time period t in region n k = 1;2 and t = 1;2) and describes what each type of depositor consumes in each period and 
xb 
n 
= x 
bn 
; xb 
n 
1 2 
describes the consumption allocation to the bank. A conse- quence of assumptions (A4) and (A5) is that productive e¢ ciency, and hence social e¢ ciency, requires that  
n 
= 1. 
For simplicity, in this section, we assume that depositors have all the bargain- ing power. In this case, as all depositors are identical ex-ante, a representative depositor, acting on behalf of all other depositors, makes a "take-it-or-leave-it" o¤er of a banking contract to the bank, which the bank can either accept or reject. 
3.2 Inter-bank markets and the –rst-best benchmark Let  = pL + (1  p)H. Clearly, the objective function of the representative depositor in each region is 
g(x) = u (x1n1) + (1 
 )u(x2n1 + x2n2) 
where g(x) is the expected utility of type 1 and type 2 depositors preferences. When there is no monitoring technology available, the representative depositor 
13Speci–cally, we assume that the bank in region 2 doesnot have the human capital to operate the assets controlled by the bank in region 1 and vice versa. This rules out the possibility of a banking contract that involves the takeover of one bank by another. 
17 

========18========

cannot condition transfers to the bank at t = 1 or at t = 2 on the invest- ment portfolio chosen by the bank at t = 0. In this case, making transfers to the bank will have no impact on the bank™s incentives. Without a monitoring technology, in any banking contract written by the representative depositor, no transfers, over and above the private non-contractible payo¤ the bank receives by operating either asset technology, will be made to the bank.

In what follows, we assume that Hx11 > 1. In this case, note that without a ex-ante interbank market, in the region with the high liquidity shock, there will be ine¢ ciently early liquidation of the long-term asset. It follows that a combination of a regional banking contract (along the lines of Diamond-Dybvig (1983)) with an ex-ante inter-bank market (along the lines of Allen and Gale (2000)) are both required to implement the ex-ante optimal risk-sharing alloca- tion. 
Ex-ante, in the interbank market, each bank exchanges claims to half of the deposits mobilized within its own region. Suppose conditional on the re- alization of the liquidity shock, region 1 faces a high liquidity shock so that proportion of type traders in region is H. In this case, the bank in region 1 liquidates its claims against the bank in region to meet its own extra liquidity needs which amount to

So a run is clearly necessary to implement any allocation with  > 0. That it is su¢ cient and may involve contagion is proved below. 
Let ˇ1 be the ex-ante (before the realization of any liquidity shocks) prob-0 ability of early liquidation for bank 1. Given ˇ1, for each

14By assumption, no other agent (including bank 
2) can replace the bank 1 to take over the operation of either illiquid asset from the bank at t = 1 which, in turn, implies that the second-best banking contract studied below is renegotiation proof. 
19 

========20========

By an analogous argument to the one presented in section 2.4, there exists a unique threshold ˇ~1, 0 < ˇ~1 < 1, such that for all ˇ1 > ˇ~1, ˇ1 < 1, the moral hazard constraint for bank 1 holds as a strict inequality for all  
1 
2 [0;1]. 
Note that the decision of a depositor to withdraw is made only after she observes her own type. Therefore, necessarily, a bank run on bank 1 can only be implemented after the realization of the liquidity shock. For a bank run on bank 1 not to involve contagion, it must be the case that the bank run occurs conditional on 2 when 1 = H and 2 = L. However, if (1  p) < ˇ~1, even if a bank run on bank 1 occurs with probability one conditional on 2, the incentive constraint of bank 1 cannot be satis–ed. In such cases, there must be a positive probability of a bank run on bank 1 conditional on 1 which necessarily implies contagion. 
Assume (1  p) < ˇ~1. Consider a randomization scheme (S; ˇ) where S = fs1; s2g and ˇ () = fˇ1 (); ˇ2 ()g is a probability distribution over S such that ˇ1 (1) = ~ˇ1  (1  p) +  (where  is small positive number), ˇ1 (2) = 1 and ˇ2 () = 1  ˇ1 (),  2 f1; 2g. The randomization scheme works as follows: at t = 0, no agent, including the bank, observes sm while at t = 1, before any choices are made and after  has been observed and each depositor privately observes her own type, the realized value of sm is revealed to all depositors but not the bank. Ex-ante, in the interbank market, each bank exchanges contingent claims to half of the deposits mobilized within its own region where claims are made contingent on fs1; s2g  f1; 2g. Clearly, claims contingent on (s2; 2) are not exchanged as the contingency (s2; 2) has a zero probability. The returns on claims contingent on (s1; ),  2 f1; 2g, are zero while each unit of a claim contingent on 
 
payout of 
 
  L 
 
(s2; 1) yields a H  x1 
1 
at t = 1 with a 
x22 at t = 2. The suspension of convertibility threshold is also made contingent on fs1; s2g  f1; 2g so that it is set at zero for all contingencies except for (s2; 1) when its is set at H. The details of such a contract follows closely the speci–cation of the banking contract in section 2.4 and is omitted. Taken together, the inter-bank market and suspension of convertibility implements –rst-best risk sharing between depositors. 
Therefore, in a second-best contract where the incentive compatibility con- straint of bank 1 binds, there is trade in the inter-bank market even allowing for the possibility of bank runs and contagion after the realization of liquidity shocks. 
We summarize the above discussion with the following proposition:

4 Policy discussion: key features of an optimal 
ex-ante intervention regime 
As noted in the introduction, a key assumption of our formal analysis is that once the investment decision by a bank has been made, the bank cannot be prevented from accessing its "private" bene–ts. For the bulk of this section, we focus on the case of a single bank and study scenarios where this assumption is relaxed by appropriate policy interventions which involve both elements of conditional monitoring, bank equity and/or contractibility of bank payo¤s. 
We assume that although an ex-ante intervention regime is put in place, all intervention is conditional on there being a bank run. The sequence of events involved is as follows. Initially, temporary bailout measures are put in place (depositor protection via emergency liquidity provision), followed by a discovery phase when the books of the bank are examined and –nally, there is a restructuring phase. Restructuring can consist of a decision to either liquidate the bank, con–scate bank payo¤s, initiate a bank takeover or leave the bank™s status unchanged15, (see, for instance, Hoggarth and Reidhill (2003), Bank of England (2009)). 
In what follows, we characterize the structure of second-best intervention in sequential monitoring scenarios where no other agent can replace the bank at t = 1. 
In this part of the paper, we will assume that conditional on a bank run it becomes common knowledge that the social planner has invested in a monitor- ing technology with a resource cost m. In keeping with the timing of events, we will assume that the resource cost is paid at t = 1. By investing in the monitoring technology, conditional on  being chosen by the bank at t = 0, the representative depositor observes a signal ˜, de–ned over subsets of [0;1] so that ˜ =  with probability q >^ 0 while ˜ = [0;1] with probability 1  q^. Conditional on monitoring at t = 1, the resource constraint is 
RA  RA 
 
x11 + (1  )x21 + m + 
 
x12 + (1  )x22 . 
For simplicity of exposition we focus on the case when there is an allocation, denoted by xm, which is a solution to (1), (2), (5) and the preceding inequality. To keep the exposition simple, we look at two cases: the case where bank "private" payo¤s aren™t contractible and the case where they aren™t. To begin with, assume the former case holds. 
Let Sm = fsm1 ; sm2 g and ˇm = fˇm1 ; ˇm2 g be a randomization scheme, de–ned independently, of the randomization scheme S0; ˇ0 studied in section 2:3. Let ! 2 f0;1g where ! = 0 indicates a situation without monitoring and ! = 1 indicates a situation with monitoring. Let rm (:; :; :; :) be a function de–ned from S0  f0;1g  
  Sm to <2+ and let kM (:; :; :) be function de–ned from S0  f0;1g  
  Sm to [0;1]. 
15This timing of events is consistent with the sequential service constraint which requires that the return obtained by a depositor depends only on her position in the queue of depositors wishing to withdraw. That a depositor can announce a desire withdraw, then await the signal and decide not to withdraw is equivalent to assuming that she can leave the queue when she changes her mind. 
21 

========22========

Consider the banking contract, subject to a sequential service constraint, described by a vector (S0; ˇ0; Sm; ˇm; m; rm; km) such that: 
(i) for all ! 2 f0;1g, ˜ 2 
 and sm 2 Sm, 
rm1 (s01;f!g;f˜g; sm) = x11 
per unit deposited at t = 0, and 
km (s01;f!g;f˜g; sm) = rm2 (s01;f!g;f˜g; sm) = 
; x22 
per unit deposited at t = 0 and not withdrawn at t = 1, 
(ii) for all ˜ 2 
 ,sm 2 Sm, 
rm1 (s02;f0g;f˜g; sm) = 1 
per unit deposited at t = 0, and 
km (s02;f0g;f˜g; sm) = 1; rm2 (s02;f0g;f˜g; sm) = 0 
per unit deposited at t = 0 and not withdrawn at t = 1, 
(iii) for all sm 2 Sm, 
rm1 (s02;f1g;f1g; sm) = xm;11 
per unit deposited at t = 0, and 
km (s02;f1g;f1g; sm) = rm2 (s02;f1g;f1g; sm) =

per unit deposited at t = 0, and 
km (s02;f1g;f  g; sm) = 1; rm2 (s02;f1g;f  g; sm) = 0 
per unit deposited at t = 0 and not withdrawn at t = 1, 
(v) when s0 = s02, 
rm1 (s02;f1g;f[0;1]g; sm1 ) = xm;11 
16We assume that 
0 < m < m <^ 1 where m^ is su¢ ciently small so that farsighted depositors always have an incentive to participate in banking. 
22 

========23========

per unit deposited at t = 0, 
km (s02;f1g;f[0;1]g; sm1 ) = rm2 (s02;f1g;f[0;1]g; sm1 ) = 
; xm;22 
per unit deposited at t = 0 and not withdrawn at t = 1, 
(vi) when s0 = s02, 
rm1 (s02;f1g;f[0;1]g; sm2 ) = 1 
 m 
per unit deposited at t = 0, 
km (s02;f1g;f[0;1]g; sm2 ) = 1; rm2 (s02;f1g;f[0;1]g; sm2 ) = 0 
per unit deposited at t = 0 and not withdrawn at t = 1. The contract also speci–es the bank™s asset portfolio where  
m 
= 1. 
The sequence of events is as follows. At t = 0, the representative depositor o¤ers the contract (S0; ˇ0; Sm; ˇm; m; rm; km). Conditional on such a contract being accepted by the bank, depositors™endowments are mobilized by the bank who, then, allocates funds across the two assets. At t = 1, a state s 2 S0 is selected according to the probability distribution ˇ0, only depositors (but not the bank) observes the realized s and a proportion 0 of depositors choose to withdraw their deposits. If 0  , there is no monitoring and each depositor j who chooses to withdraw a fraction j of her deposits obtains a return of x11 per unit deposited at t = 0 while a depositor j who withdraws a fraction 1  j of her deposits obtains a return of x22 per unit deposited at t = 0 and not withdrawn at t = 1. If on the other hand, 0 > , there is a temporary suspension of convertibility for all depositors, and the representative depositor operates the monitoring technology at a –xed cost m. Conditional on monitoring taking place, a state sm 2 Sm is chosen according to the probability distribution ˇm. Conditional on s 2 S0, the signal ˜ and the state of the world sm, the suspension of convertibility threshold is set according to km. At this point, each depositor who has chosen to withdraw a positive fraction her deposits can leave the queue of depositors. If a depositor j remains in the queue, and continues to choose to withdraw a fraction j of her deposits, then, subject to a sequential service constraint, she obtains a return of rm1 per unit deposited at t = 0 while a depositor j who leaves the queue obtains a return of rm2 per unit deposited at t = 0 and not withdrawn at t = 1. 
Using arguments symmetric to the ones used in establishing proposition 2, for each s 2 S0, it is a dominant action for type one depositors to withdraw, while it is a dominant action for type two depositors not to withdraw at t = 1 if the realized state is s01, and for type two depositors to withdraw at t = 1 if the realized state is s02. Therefore, there is no monitoring at t = 1 if the realized state is s01 while monitoring is triggered if the realized state is s02. Conditional on monitoring, it is a dominant action for type one depositors to not to leave the queue of depositors. If ˜ = 1 or ˜ = [0;1] and conditional on monitoring, 
23 

========24========

the realized state is sm1 , then it is a dominant action for type one depositors to not to leave the queue of depositors but if ˜ < 1 or ˜ = [0;1] and conditional on monitoring, the realized state is sm2 , then it is a dominant action for type two depositors not to leave the queue and continue to want to withdraw their deposits at t = 1. Let ˇm = ˇ02 (1  q^)ˇm2 . Anticipating this behavior by depositors, the bank will choose  =

It follows, using arguments symmetric to the one used in establishing proposition 2, there exists ˇ~m > 0, ˇ~m < 1 such that the bank™s incentive compatibility constraint is satis–ed i¤ ˇm  ˇ~m. Therefore, setting ˇm = ~ˇm + ", for some " strictly positive but close to zero makes it a dominant action for the bank to choose  =  
m 
= 1. 
In this set-up, conditional on  = 1, the probability of termination is ˇ02 (1  q^)ˇm2 < ˇ~: in other words, e¢ cient risk-sharing in implemented with higher probability when there is costly but imperfect monitoring relative to the random contract studied earlier. 
So far we have assumed that the bank™s payo¤s are non-contractible and cannot be attached or con–scated by an outside agent (a court). What are the consequences of dropping this assumption? 
We –rst, examine the case where a proportion  of the bank™s non-contractible payo¤s can be seized directly by an outside agent like a benevolent social planner or a court. Next, we study what happens if, in addition to mobilizing deposits, there is bank equity which can be used a collateral. 
First, assume that a proportion  , 0    1, of the bank™s private payo¤s can be seized by a court. For simplicity, assume that all the other assump- tions made in section 2 continue to hold. When  is large enough, i.e. when R 
b 
B 
 cB < RbA  cA, it immediately follows that there is a banking con- tract which will implement the allocation x. Indeed, consider the conditional monitoring contract (S0; ˇ0; Sm; ˇm; m; rm; km) studied above augmented by a commitment by the social planner to con–scate R 
b 
B 
if banking continues to t = 2. In such case, it is easily checked that at t = 0, the bank will choose  = 1 and it will be dominant strategy for type one depositors to withdraw at t = 1 and type two depositors to withdraw at t = 2. 
Of course, when R 
b 
B 
> RbA, the positive probability of bank runs on the equilibrium path of play will be required to satisfy the bank™s incentives. With monitoring and transfers, either the threat of bank runs o¤ the equilibrium path of play and/or the positive probability of bank runs on the equilibrium path of play may be required to satisfy the bank™s incentives. 
So far we have assumed that the bank has no endowment of the good at t = 0. Suppose now the bank is endowed with K > 0 units of the good at t = 0. Then, in addition to mobilizing the deposits of investors, the bank can invest its own endowment in either of the two asset technologies. We will assume that 
24 

========25========

any investment the bank makes of its own endowments at t = 0 is treated by the representative depositor as collateral i.e. as an asset the representative depositor can seize contingent on the information the she has on the action chosen by the bank. Again, for simplicity, assume that all the other assumptions made in section 2 continue to hold. In such a case, the funds available to the bank at t = 0 is (1 + K) and if the bank invests  in asset technology A, the public return, if banking continues to t = 2 will be (1 + K) ( R 
A 
+ (1   )RB) while theb 
private non-contractible return to the bank will be (1 + K)

B 
. If at t = 2 , the representative depositor seizes the collateral, the return to the 
bank will be 
 
R 
b 
A 
+ (1   )RbB ; in other words, by con–scating the bank™s collateral, a proportional portion of its private, non-contractible payo¤s can be seized by the representative depositor. It follows that for  = 1 to be incentive compatible for the bank, K must satisfy the inequality

Suppose K  Kb. Suppose the social planner can verify the collateral put up by the bank at t = 0 but, as before, cannot verify how the bank chooses to distribute the total funds mobilized for investment between the two assets. In 
this case the banking contract 
 
S0; ˇ0; Sm; ˇm; m; rK; km where rK1 = xK;11 per unit deposited at t = 0, while rK2 = x2 
K;2 
per unit deposited at t = 0 and not withdrawn at t = 1, will implement xK in dominant strategies. 
However, when K < Kb the positive probability of bank runs on the equi- librium path of play will be required to satisfy the bank™s incentives. Remark that 
RbB  cB 
Rb 
is a measure of the the non-contractible payo¤ gains, to the

bank, from choosing by investing in asset B relative to investing in asset A. When K < Kb, the physical collateral put up by the bank is small relative to the (non-contractible) payo¤ gains generated by moral hazard. 
With monitoring and transfers, either the threat of bank runs o¤ the equilib- rium path of play and/or the positive probability of bank runs on the equilibrium path of play may be required to satisfy the bank™s incentives. 
Remark: How would the policy change if there were multiple banks? Con- sider the scenario studied in section 3. A precondition for the threat of takeovers to work, it must be the case that the bank in region 2 has the human capital to operate the assets controlled by the bank in region 1. In this case, the threat of a takeover, conditional on the realization of the liquidity shock and possibly the sunspot variable, would implement the ex ante e¢ cient allocation.

5 Conclusion 
We interpret the signi–cance of our results in four ways. First, our results show that with moral hazard, bank runs and contagion are necessary elements in second-best banking scenarios and the randomness introduced by banking con- tracts studied here is uncorrelated with fundamentals driven purely by incen- tives. In this sense our results provide a theoretical foundation for the doctrine of "creative ambiguity". Second, we show that global contagion can result with even local moral hazard. Third, our result shows that in low asset economies, where productive agents like banks or –rms with little or no collateral, appropri- ately designed random demandable debt contracts Pareto improve on autarky. Finally, we examine how appropriate policy interventions could improve banking outcomes by eliminating ine¢ cient early termination via an ex ante intervention regime with monitoring using bank equity as collateral and/or restoring partial contractibility of "private" bank payo¤s. Of course, in scenario with multiple banks, as in section 3, the threat of takeovers could also be used, under certain conditions, as a key feature of such an intervention regime. 
Extending our result to examine episodes of twinned bank runs and currency crises is a topic for future research.

Consider the banking contract ; ^ r;^ k^ as speci–ed in section 2:2. The payo¤ to per unit of deposit withdrawn at t = 1, which depends on the fraction of deposits serviced before agent j, kj, is given by the expression 
ˆ 
v^1(fj;r^1;k^) = 
u(^r1); if kj  k;^ 
u(0); kj > k^ 
while the period 2 payo¤ per unit deposit withdrawn at t = 2, which depends on total fraction of deposits withdrawn in period 1, k, is given by the expression 
ˆ 
v^2(f;r^1) = 
u(^r2); if 1 > kr^1; 
0; otherwise 
At t = 1, the above contract induces a noncooperative game between depos- itors where each depositor chooses what fraction of their deposits to with- 
draw. Suppose depositor j withdraws a fraction j. Then, a type 1 deposi- tor obtains a payo¤ ) 
k^) + 
 
jv^1(kj;r^1; k^ while a type 2 depositor obtains a payo¤ of jv^1(kj;r^1; 1  j v^2(k;r^1). Remark that for a type 1 depositor, j = 1 strictly dominates all other actions. As k^ = , r^1 = x11 and r^2 = x22 , it follows that v^2(k;r^1) > v^1(kj;r^1) and for type 2 depositors, j = 0 strictly dominates all other actions and therefore, k = k^ = . The bank™s payo¤s are 
v^b (  ) = R 
b 
A 
+ (1 
  )RbB 
 ( c 
A 
+ (1 
  )cB) 
There is only one subgame at t = 1 (as depositors don™t observe the bank™s choice of  ). As RbA  cA < RbB  cB and , at t = 1, 1  k^r^1 > 0, choosing  = ^  
A 
is a strictly dominant choice for the bank. 
