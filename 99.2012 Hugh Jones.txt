Abstract:  Field studies of conflict report cycles of mutual revenge between groups, often linked to  
perceptions of intergroup injustice. We test the hypothesis that people are predisposed to reciprocate 
against groups. In a computerized laboratory experiment, subjects who were harmed by a partner’s  
uncooperative action reacted by harming other members of the partner’s group. This group  
reciprocity  was only observed when one group was seen to be unfairly advantaged.  Our results  
support a behavioral mechanism leading from perceived injustice to intergroup conflict. We discuss  
the relevance of group reciprocity to economic and political phenomena including conflict,  
discrimination and team competition.

Introduction 
Laboratory experiments show that humans are prepared to reciprocate wrongs by harming the  
offender, even at a cost to themselves (Fehr and Gächter 2000). Field studies of ethnic and  
communal violence report tit-for-tat processes, with attacks on one group being avenged by attacks  
on (previously uninvolved) members of the attackers’ group (Horowitz 1985, 2001; Chagnon 1988). 
For example, in Atlanta, 1906, after a spate of newspaper coverage of black attacks on white  
women, a group of whites went downtown to a black neighborhood and killed 25 black men  
(Bauerlein 2001). Similarly, after an argument between an Indian Dalit and an upper caste farmer,  
upper caste villagers attacked 80 Dalit families and subsequently imposed a “social boycott”,  
forcing Dalits to leave the village (Hoff et al. 2011). Such reports suggest that humans reciprocate  
not only towards individuals, but also towards entire groups, even if this means harming innocent  
people. 
This behavior, which we call “group reciprocity”, could explain the persistence of intractable  
conflicts which hinder development in many of the world's poorest states (World Bank 2011).  
Group reciprocity may also affect the international macroeconomy. Keynes (1922), describing the  
Treaty of Paris’ intentional devastation of the German economy, quoted Thomas Hardy: “Nought  
remains / But vindictiveness here amid the strong, / And there amid the weak an impotent rage. ”  
Similar motivations might be at play between German and Greek voters in the current European  
crisis. 
We conducted a computerized laboratory experiment to test for group reciprocity, looking both for  
direct group reciprocity in response to actions affecting oneself, and for indirect group reciprocity,  
in response to actions affecting others (Nowak and Sigmund 2005). Individual transgressions do not 
always lead to retaliation against an entire group, so it is important to learn when and why this  
2 

========3========

occurs. Our controlled laboratory conditions allow us to test different causal explanations in a way  
hard to achieve with field research.  In particular, many studies suggest that intergroup inequality  
and injustice lead to intergroup conflict (Tambiah 1996; Horowitz 2001; Cederman et al. 2011).  
Group reciprocity might provide one mechanism for this causal link: in a context of intergroup  
unfairness, resentment at one individual’s actions may spread towards that person’s entire group,  
and lead to intergroup revenge behavior. We therefore use different treatments to vary the perceived  
unfairness of intergroup allocations. 
Our results support the hypothesis that humans group-reciprocate. We find little evidence for  
indirect group reciprocity, but strong evidence for direct group reciprocity. We also confirm that  
there is a link with perceived unfairness. Subjects only group-reciprocated when a large reward had  
been arbitrarily  allocated to one group, and subjects who saw the intergroup allocation as unfair  
were more likely to group-reciprocate. 
The impact of group membership on human behavior was first studied by social psychologists  
(Sumner 1906; Sherif et al. 1961; Tajfel et al. 1971). More recently economists have taken up the  
same topic, using laboratory and field experiments. The literature shows some fairly robust results.  
People cooperate more with in-group members (de Cremer and van Vugt 1999; Goette et al. 2006,  
Guala et al. 2012). Group members give more to each other, punish each other less for misbehavior  
and reward each other more for good behavior (Bernhard et al. 2006; Chen and Li 2009; Currarini  
and Mengel 2012). Moreover, people place a value on their group membership, and prefer to  
interact with others from their own group (Hargreaves-Heap and Zizzo 2009; Currarini and Mengel  
2012).  
None of these phenomena, by itself, appears sufficient to explain historically observed episodes of  
extreme violence against outgroups  (Brewer 1999). Indeed, the in-group bias shown in allocating  
goods disappears when subjects allocate a “bad” such as exposure to aversive noise (Mummendey  
3 

========4========

et al. 1992). Psychologists have therefore developed broader theories of intergroup emotions to  
explain how people react to outgroups; these include “vicarious retribution”, a propensity to  
retaliate against the group (Lickel et al. 2006). Experiments on vicarious retribution thus far have  
examined only verbal attitudes (Stenstrom et al. 2008), or cannot cleanly distinguish individual- 
level reciprocity from group reciprocity (Gaertner et al. 2008). 
Some economic experiments have examined group-level outcomes of intergroup dynamics  
(Bornstein et al. 1992, 2003; Abbink and Herrmann 2009). Group reciprocity may play a similar  
explanatory role here to standard reciprocity in public goods games (Fehr et al. 2000), by providing  
the individual-level psychological mechanism underlying phenomena such as costly vendettas and  
increased effort in intergroup Prisoner’s Dilemmas. 
The interpretation of experiments on reciprocity remains debated: do they show “strong  
reciprocity”, i.e.  reciprocity as a primitive in the utility function, or only “a misapplication... of a  
heuristic rule ” derived from settings where intergroup reciprocity may be individually rational  
(Guala 2012)? Our experiment is compatible with both interpretations. We simply claim that in  
either case, it provides valuable evidence about human behavioral dispositions. 
Experiment design 
We ran 15 sessions of 16 subjects each. Each session was divided into two parts: a group quiz and a  
sequence of 2-player public goods games. In each session, subjects were randomly allocated into  
four color-coded groups of four: green, orange, purple, and brown. Each subject’s color group was  
shown on screen throughout the experiment. Payments were shown in Experimental Currency Units 
(ECU) with 1 ECU = 5 Euro cent. 
After the group assignment, groups were given a 10-minute quiz consisting of 20 multiple-choice  
questions. Answers were chosen individually, but members of each group could communicate with  
4 

========5========

each other via online chat. (It was forbidden to communicate personal information; chat records  
show that all subjects followed these instructions.) Each group member’s correct answer was  
rewarded with 10 ECU for the group. A group’s earnings were divided equally among its members,  
and 100 ECU per subject were used as an endowment for the second part of the experiment. To  
ensure that each subject had at least 100 ECU, minimum group earnings of 400 ECU were  
implemented. This is purely a framing manipulation to increase subjects’ sense that they had  
“earned” their ECU.  
The group quiz had two functions: building group identity, by giving groups a common task and an  
element of common fate; and creating between-group inequality (Chen and Li 2009). To increase  
this and to manipulate subjects’ perceptions of the fairness of intergroup allocations, we gave one  
group a 100 ECU bonus. In 3 “winner bonus” sessions, the group with the most points was awarded 
the bonus. In the remaining 12 “random bonus” sessions, this bonus was instead given to a  
randomly selected group. In both cases, the instructions explained how the bonus would be  
awarded, and the group receiving the bonus was announced directly after the quiz. We expected  
subjects to perceive between-group inequality as less fair when the bonus was awarded randomly. 
The quiz was followed by a brief questionnaire.  Subjects then played eight repetitions of a two  
round, two player public goods game.  In each repetition, subjects were re-matched into groups of 4  
with members of different colors. They could observe all group members’ color, as well as their  
earnings from the quiz. The 4 subjects were then matched into pairs for each of the two rounds. 
The basic structure of each repetition is always the same. Subjects played a public goods game with  
one other subject from the four. They then received feedback about one other subject’s play from  
the four, who we label F. Lastly, they played another public goods game with one other subject from 
the four: the second round partner, whom we label P.

second round partner  
Different treatments used different matching, illustrated in Figure 1. In “first party” treatments,  
subjects were paired “horizontally” in the first round and received feedback on their partner’s play:  
i.e., F was the subject’s own first round partner. In the second choice, subjects were paired  
“diagonally”. Thus, subjects learnt about how F had played against them in the first round, and  
could then react to this by playing differently against P in the second round. These treatments test  
for direct or “first party” group reciprocity. 
 In third party treatments, first choices were made with the horizontal player, but feedback was  
given (only) on the behavior of the diagonal player. Then subjects played the horizontal player  
again. Thus, subjects learnt about how F had played against another participant in the first round,  
and could react to this by playing differently against P in the second round. These treatments test for 
“indirect” or “third party” group reciprocity.  
Because conflicts are often modelled as prisoners' dilemmas (Hardin 1995; Fearon and Laitin  
1999), we chose to implement a standard linear public goods game in each round: the two subjects  
shared a fund of 100 ECU, where 50 tokens were taken from each of the two subjects' earnings  
6 

========7========

from the quiz. Each could then take up to 50 ECU from the fund. ECU remaining in the fund were  
multiplied by 1.5 and shared equally between the two. Withdrawing tokens from the fund is thus  
harmful for one’s partner because it reduces his earnings from the quiz. In the worst case (subject  
withdraws nothing, partner withdraws 50 tokens), the subject (after rounding) receives only 36  
tokens. The partner would in this case earn the maximum possible of 86 tokens.  In case neither  
subject withdraws anything, both earn 75 tokens. Total earnings from one random repetition were  
used for payment.  
Cross-cutting treatments varied the color group membership of the four subjects, as Figure 2 shows. 
F's action might influence subjects’ play against second round partners from all groups, due to  
imitation or generalized reciprocity (Dufwenberg et al. 2001; Nowak and Roch 2007). For clean  
identification of reciprocity towards groups, in different group  ( same group) repetitions, F and P  
were from different groups (the same group).  In addition, in own same group  ( own different group)  
repetitions, the “vertical” player was from the subject’s own group  (another group) . In third party  
repetitions, this allows us to examine the effect of the group membership of the other participant  
helped or harmed by F: do subjects react more strongly when F’s action affects a member of their  
own group? To avoid a confound with in-group altruism, subjects never shared group membership  
with the feedback player F, or with either of their partners in the public goods game.  
After the second round, subjects learned the choices of all their partners in the repetition, and their  
total earnings from the repetition. They were then rematched into different groups of 4 for the next  
repetition. The rematching ensured that all subjects experienced all 8 treatments:{first party, third  
party} ×  {same group, different group}  ×  {own same group, own different group}. This “within  
subjects” design allows more accurate inferences about group reciprocity’s individual-level  
covariates. Treatments were balanced over repetitions.

After the eight repetitions, subjects answered a questionnaire including demographics, measures of  
group identity, reactions to other groups, and questions about the experiment. Lastly payments were 
made privately. 
Supplementary Treatments 
The feedback player F’s choice might influence subjects’ play either by changing preferences  
towards their second round partner P, or by changing expectations about P’s play. To investigate  
this, in repetitions 2 and 7 of sessions 1-10 and 13-15, expectations about P’s choice were elicited.  
8 

========9========

These were incentivized by a payment based on the difference between the guess and the true  
amount taken by the partner (details in appendix table A2).  
In sessions 11-12, among each group of four, one player’s second round amount taken was  
determined randomly, by a computerized draw from the uniform distribution on {0,...,50}. The  
player and his or her second round partner were informed of this in advance. All players were paid  
as normal. This allows us to examine the effect of expectations in a different way, by holding S’s  
expectations of P’s behavior constant. In order to focus on first party group reciprocity, these  
sessions only included first party treatments, with two repetitions of each color treatment. 
To test the “contact hypothesis” that prejudice can be reduced by cooperation on a common task, in  
sessions 13-15 the public good games were interrupted after 4 repetitions to play an additional 5  
minute quiz containing 10 questions. As before, participants could chat with each other to answer  
the questions. However, this time, while one color group in each session chatted only within itself,  
the other 3 color groups were redistributed into new groups of four, so that they chatted with  
members from different color groups. Color group membership was shown in the chat window. The  
public goods games were then continued for the 4 final rounds.

To identify group reciprocity, we run regressions of the following form: 
Second round take  = α +  β  F take  + γ  Same group +  δ ( F take × Same group) + Xθ + ε.  (1) 
Here, β gives the partial correlation between F take, the amount taken by the feedback participant F, 
and the subject’s Second round take  against his second round partner P, when F and P are in  
11 

========12========

different groups. The sum β + δ gives this correlation when F and P are in the Same group. δ is the  
extra correlation caused by group membership, i.e.,  the level of group reciprocity. We expect δ > 0.  
X  is a vector of possible controls.  
Our key results are as follows. 
Result 1:  Subjects showed first party group reciprocity in random bonus sessions, but not in winner 
bonus sessions. 
Result 2:  Subjects did not group-reciprocate behavior towards third parties. 
Figure 3 plots F take  against  Second round take  in first party treatments during random bonus  
sessions. As expected, the slope of Second round take  on  F take  was about doubled when F and P  
were from the same group.  
12 

========13========

Figure 3: Mean observed subjects’ taking against P, by F’s taking, first party treatments, random  bonus sessions. Bars show ±  1 s.d. + p < 0.10;   ** p < 0.01. Top plot is histogram of amount taken by F. 
Subjects’ choices within a session may not be independent. Therefore, to test for significance, we  
first calculate values of β and β + δ in (1) separately for each session, and treat them  as a single  
matched pair of observations.  This procedure is analogous to running non-parametric statistics on  
session averages: here, instead of a session average, we are using a partial correlation. Within first  
party treatments, β + δ was higher than β in 11 out of 12 random bonus sessions, but in no winner  
bonus sessions. The null hypothesis is that β and β + δ are distributed with the same mean  
(equivalently, the mean δ is 0). A signed-rank test on the matched pairs rejects this  over all sessions 
at p = 0.0353 (two-sided), and over random bonus sessions only at p = 0.00928 (two-sided). We  
13 

========14========

found no evidence for group reciprocity in third party treatments: β + δ  was higher than  β in 7 out  
of 10 random bonus sessions and 2 out of 3 winner bonus sessions (p = 0.216, two-sided, over all  
sessions). 
Next we examine individual behavior. Table 3 estimates (1) for both first and third party treatments. 
Column 1 pools data from all sessions, columns 2 and 3 use random and winner bonus sessions  
respectively. In first party treatments, the δ coefficient on F take × Same group is positive and  
highly significant in random bonus sessions (and pooling the data), but not in winner bonus  
sessions. In third party treatments, δ is small and insignificant. These results are robust to  
alternative specifications.2 
2  These include using session-clustered standard errors; adding per individual and per repetition  dummies; adding controls for the history of play; and running Tobit regressions to account for the  many observations at 0 and 50. The appendix reports these analyses.

To find correlates of group reciprocity, we focus on first party treatments in random bonus sessions.  
First, we want to check our interpretation that the random bonus sessions caused group reciprocity  
by making subjects feel that the inter-group distribution of income was unfair. Our post-quiz  
questionnaire included a 1-5 Likert scale “Did you feel that the quiz was fair?” Answers were  
significantly less positive in random bonus sessions (Goodman and Kruskal’s gamma, p = 0.072).

Result 3:  Subjects who perceived the quiz as unfair showed more group reciprocity. 
Column 1 of Table 4 interacts equation (1) with a dummy variable Fair, which is 1 if the subject  
perceived the quiz as (very fair or) fair and 0 otherwise. The coefficient on F take × Same group × 
Fair is negative and significant. Subjects who perceived the quiz as unfair were about three-and-a- 
half times more group-reciprocal (0.362 versus 0.362 - 0.251 = 0.101). Including winner bonus  
sessions in these regressions gives similar results3; controlling for fairness perceptions reduces but  
does not eliminate the difference between sessions.

Result 4:  Group reciprocity remained significant after controlling for subjects’ expectations of their 
second round partner’s choices, and also when those choices were made randomly by the computer. 
The feedback participant F’s actions might change the subject’s expectations about other members  
of F’s group, including P. Subjects might then group-reciprocate because of these expectations, e.g.  
if they wish to match P’s expected take, rather than because they directly wished to harm F’s group  
members. This would be a form of statistical discrimination (Arrow 1971), which may be important 
in explaining real-world group reciprocal behavior. However, capturing it in the laboratory is not  
very informative, because it is unclear what expectations subjects ought to hold about correlations  
of behavior among color group members.4 
To see if group reciprocity was explained by expectations, column 2 of table 4 adds Expectations to  
the basic regression. To increase efficiency, we multiply impute Expectations  for repetitions where  
it was not elicited. Expectations  is highly significant, and the  δ coefficient on F take × Same group 
is approximately halved. However, it remains weakly significant.5 
Subjects’ stated expectations may be affected by their intended play, for example due to self- 
justification (Messé and Sivacek 1979). Therefore, we used a further method to control for  
expectations. In sessions 11-12, some subjects’ second round choices were made randomly by a  
computerized draw from the uniform distribution on {0,...,50}. Their partners knew this, and both  
partners were paid as normal. Subjects’ expectations about P’s play ought to be unaffected by F’s  
play in this case.6  Column 3 of Table 4 interacts equation (1) with a dummy variable  Random  
choice, which is 1 when P’s choice was random. The coefficient on F take ×  Same group  ×  
Random choice  is actually positive, and  δ plus this coefficient remains significantly positive

(p=0.050). We conclude that group reciprocity was not driven solely by expectations. 
Result 5:  Intergroup cooperation did not reduce group reciprocity. 
The “contact hypothesis”, that intergroup contact can reduce prejudice, has a long pedigree within  
social psychology (Sherif et al. 1961, Pettigrew 1998). Subsequent research has emphasized that  
contact alone may not be enough; subjects may need to cooperate on a common task (Gaertner et al. 
1993). We test whether group reciprocity can be decreased by an episode of cooperation between  
different groups. In 3 sessions, after 4 repetitions a second quiz took place, in which some subjects  
could cooperate with members of other groups. Column 4 of Table 4 interacts equation (1) with a  
dummy Open quiz 2, for these subjects in repetitions 5-8. There is no evidence that this prevented  
group reciprocity: all interaction terms are small and insignificant. These null results are not  
definitive, since a longer interaction between groups might have broken down group reciprocity  
more effectively. Nevertheless, they suggest that the tendency to reciprocate actions by outgroup  
members is not easy to break down. 
Another interesting non-result concerns gender. Some evolutionary theories of group identification  
predict that men and women should possess different group psychology; in particular, men should  
be more coalition-minded (Sidanius and Pratto 1999). Certainly, men are more directly active in  
violent intergroup conflicts (Goldstein 2003). However: 
Result 6:  Men and women showed equal levels of group reciprocity. 
Table 5 shows separate estimations of (1) for men and women. The results are strikingly similar.  
Whatever differentiates men and women’s conflict behavior, it is not this aspect of psychology. 
19

The appendix tests the above results in a variety of specifications, and also details some others.  
High-earning participants’ actions appear to have caused more group reciprocity, consistent with a  
link between inequality and group reciprocity. Subjects with a strong in-group identity may have  
been more group-reciprocal.

Conclusion 
Group membership matters to social and economic behavior (Arrow 1998; Akerlof and Kranton

2005, 2010; Sen 2007). In this paper we move beyond static considerations of identity and consider  
how groups react to each other. Our laboratory experiment allows us to confirm hypotheses from  
the field in a controlled setting. 
Many intractable conflicts are driven by cycles of intergroup revenge, in which uninvolved  
bystanders are harmed for their fellow group members’ supposed actions. Some observers blame  
not deep intergroup hatreds but self-interested politicians and hired thugs (Brass 1997; Kaufman  
2001; cf. Glaeser 2005). Our results, however, show that humans reciprocate towards groups even  
absent these factors; this psychology could provide the demand for conflict which politicians  
exploit. We also showed the conditions for the motivation to operate. Uncooperative actions  
triggered group reciprocity only in unfair contexts, when a randomly selected group received a large 
reward. 
It would be of interest to know how group reciprocity might evolve. One possibility is that it  
developed as a mechanism for preserving intergroup peace: human ethnic groups mainly live at  
peace with their neighbors (Fearon and Laitin 1996), whereas e.g. chimpanzee intergroup relations  
appear violent by default (Wilson and Wrangham 2003). In the context of within-group alliances,  
primates appear to reciprocate against attackers’ kin (Aureli at al. 1992), which suggests that the  
underlying behavioral propensity may be quite ancient.  But reciprocity in the field might also be  
driven by strategic incentives, with subjects bringing the resulting behavioral heuristic into the  
laboratory (Chagnon 1988; Hardin 1995; Fearon and Laitin 1996).  
We draw consequences from our research for several fields. First, experiments on ethnic  
heterogeneity have used one-shot interactions to reveal intergroup prejudice and discrimination  
(Fershtman and Gneezy 2001; Habyarimana et al. 2009). Future work should examine intergroup  
dynamics: how group members react  to other groups’ behavior (cf. Bornhorst et al. 2009). Second,  
economists of  conflict should consider the possibility of endogenous preference change. For  
21 

========22========

example, counter-terrorist strategies which might deter a rational terrorist actor (Arce and Sandler  
2005) may risk increasing revenge motivations and thereby terrorist recruitment.  
Most importantly, there is a complex behavioral connection between perceived intergroup  
unfairness and conflict. Much more needs to be done to understand how this works: what contexts  
create breeding grounds for intergroup resentment, and how does this psychology play out in  
particular environments? We look forward to more research on this topic. Field experiments have  
examined the effect of violent conflict on preferences (Blattman 2009; Cassar et al. 2011; Voors et  
al. 2012); further work could explore the behavioral factors behind individuals’ selection into  
conflict. Intergroup dynamics may also be expressed in more routine forms of discrimination, as in  
Shayo and Zussman’s (2011) finding that both Arab and Jewish judges in Israel favour their in- 
group more after terrorist attacks. Group reciprocity could also affect team production and team  
competition in firms. For instance, employees may reduce cooperation and “shirk” when they feel  
that certain groups receive bonuses not available for other employees.  In public economics,  
perceptions that certain groups act corruptly or manipulate the tax system to their own advantage  
may lead disadvantaged groups to behave non-cooperatively, possibly by evading taxes (cf. Alm  
and Torgler 2006). Ultimately, understanding intergroup dynamics could help businesses and  
policy-makers to manage them more productively and to forestall some of their worst effects.

1. Experimental details 
Before experiment 
After entering the lab, subjects drew a number assigning them to their seats. In 5 sessions, seats  
were located at desks surrounded by blinds, effectively creating a private cubicle. In the remaining  
10 sessions, seats were placed in a separate cabin which could be closed with a curtain. At each  
seat, subjects found a copy of the instructions and a paper receipt slip to be used for their payment  
next to the computer screen. After all subjects took their place, instructions were read out loud. (The 
information provided in the instructions covered the structure of the experiment, a complete  
description of the games to be played and payment structures. An English translation of the  
instructions can be found below.) 
Quiz questions 
The questions in the quiz were chosen to provoke communication, i.e. we expected not everybody  
to individually be able to answer correctly, but possibly so within the group. The average number of 
chat entries per group were 81, i.e., roughly, each subject made one chat entry per question. In order 
to avoid frustration, simpler questions were also included. On average, 61% of the questions were  
answered correctly. The English translation of the questions is shown in Table A1.

Directly after the quiz, subjects answered a brief questionnaire containing three questions. We asked 
these early to ensure that behavior in the public goods games did not affect subjects’ answers.  
Answers could be given by selecting a point on a 5-point Likert scale. Subjects were asked:  
1) How much did you enjoy the quiz? (“Not at all” = 1, “Very much” = 5)  
2) How well do you think your group performed in the quiz? (“Very badly” = 1, “Very well” =  
5) 
3) How fair did you think the quiz was? (“Not at all fair” = 1, “Very fair” = 5) 
A final questionnaire ended the experiment. The questionnaire included questions on gender, age,  
major subject, native language, whether any of the other subjects were personally acquainted, and  
the possibility to comment on the experiment. It also included open questions on what subjects  
believed the experiment to be about and a brief explanation of their choices of the course of the  
experiment. Mostly, subjects thought the experiment to be about the influence of income on  
decision behavior, the correlation of certain behaviors with intelligence, or social dilemmas. Only 3  
of the 240 subjects mentioned objectives related to group reciprocity (“treat colors differently”,  
“memorize behavior according to color”, “do decisions of un-encountered others affect my  
behavior”). To get indicators of ingroup identity and fairness we added three statements which  
subjects could agree/disagree with on a 7-point Likert scale: 
– I felt committed to my group 
– I think the experiment was fair towards all (color) groups 
– I enjoyed the experiment 
Perceptions of other groups were also elicited by Likert scales. Statements read as follows (each  
statement was given 4 times, once for each color group): 
30 

========31========

– Members  of the green/orange/purple/brown group worked together well as a team 
– Members  of the green/orange/purple/brown group behaved fairly towards other groups 
Following the questionnaire, subjects were given information on which round was chosen for  
payment and their total earnings. Subjects were called up individually by seat number (after the  
respective previous subject had left the lab) and signed a receipt slip for the money.   
Eliciting expectations 
In sessions 1-10 and 13-15, subjects were asked about their expectations on the choice of the  
matched partner in order to check whether individuals' choices were influenced by the expectations  
on the matched partner's behavior. So as to keep the experiment simple and fast-moving,  
expectations were only elicited in repetitions 2 and 7.  Expectations were incentivized in that the  
difference between the indicated expectation and the true amount withdrawn by the partner  
determined the size of an extra bonus to be gained. Table A2 illustrates how the possible boni were  
determined. 
Difference 0-4 5-9 10-14 Bonus 10 ECU 9 ECU 8 ECU

Second quiz 
Sessions 13-15 contained a second quiz after the first 4 repetitions of the public goods game, in

2. Supplementary analyses of main results 
We first explore the basic patterns in our data. Figure A1 shows the distribution of amounts taken.  
There are many observations of both 0, the minimum possible take, and 50, the maximum, which  
means that tobit regressions may be appropriate. Figure A2 shows mean amounts taken over all  
sessions, in each of the 8 repetitions. As is typical for a public goods game, amounts taken increased 
over the course of the experiment.

Figure A2: amount taken, repetitions 1-8 
Subjects’ behavior within a single session may not be independent, because subjects may influence  
each other, either through their play over the repeated rounds with rematching, or via chat during  
the quiz. We use two alternative strategies to deal with this. First, we treat each session as a single  
independent observation and run non-parametric tests on session-level statistics. Second, we run  
regressions on individual decisions, cluster standard errors by individual, and include covariates in  
order to control explicitly for the history of play. An alternative approach would be to cluster  
standard errors at the  session level. We believe that errors are likely to be most strongly correlated  
within individuals, at least when individual-level fixed effects are not included; in any case, the  
coefficient on F take × Same group  remains highly significant if we cluster at session level (results  
available on request). 
At session level, Figures A3 and A4 show the coefficient on F take × Same group in equation (1),  
estimated by simple linear regression without controls for each session, separately for first and third 
party treatments. We use Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to test whether the values of these coefficients  
34 

========35========

are significantly different from 0 (equivalently, whether the coefficients on F take  are significantly  
larger when Same group  is 1: thus, the test uses matched pairs of observations from each session for 
Same group  = 1 and  Same group  = 0). Table A4 shows two-sided p-values for first and third party  
treatments in winner bonus and random bonus sessions. It also shows tests pooling all sessions. In  
third party treatments, δ is never significantly different from 0, while in first party treatments δ is  
significantly different from 0, whether we pool all sessions or examine random bonus sessions  
alone.

Next, we take individual decisions as the unit of observation. We would like to know if we can pool  
our different session types for analysis. As a first gauge of this, we examine the δ coefficient on F  
take ×  Same group  in first party treatments. Table A5 estimates equation (1) separately for each

type of session. In first party treatments, δ  is not significantly different between the different sub- 
types of random bonus session (sessions 4-10 vs 11-12: p=0.171; 4-10 vs 13-15: p=0.395, 11-12 vs  
13-15: p=0.622), but it is significantly different between the winner bonus sessions and sessions 11- 
12 (p=0.0146) and sessions 13-15 (p=0.0395), and narrowly misses significance at the 10% level  
between the winner bonus sessions and sessions 4-10 (p=0.107). This suggests that we can pool the  
random bonus sessions without undue violence to the data. In third party treatments, δ is always  
insignificant and does not vary significantly between session types.

Next, we pool data from all the random bonus sessions, and test equation (1) in various  
specifications. Column 1 of Table A6 reports an OLS regression without controls. Column 2 adds in 
subject and repetition dummies (in econometric language, individual and time fixed effects).  The  
subject dummies control for individual-level variation in baseline propensity to take: in effect, this  
regression uses the correlation between changes  in  F take and Same group  and  changes  in  
individuals’ second round take. The time dummies control for changes in average cooperation over  
38 

========39========

time. Using fixed effects has advantages and disadvantages. Clearly there is much heterogeneity  
between individuals, and this might be correlated with the propensity to group-reciprocate; fixed  
effects mitigate this worry. On the other hand, using fixed effects throws away the information  
contained in differences between individuals, which can be substantial. Column 3 removes the fixed 
effects, but adds a vector of controls reflecting the history of play experienced by each individual.  
Specifically, we add the amount taken by the subject’s partners in each round of the previous  
repetition, as well as the amount taken by the subject’s feedback participant (F) in the previous  
repetition. (Further lags proved insignificant.) We also add Last take same group, which is the  
amount taken by the subject’s last partner (in any round and repetition) who was in the same group  
as the current second-round partner P. The lagged variables in general have the expected sign, but  
are not strongly significant. However, the coefficient on Last take same group  is large and highly  
significant in both first and third party treatments. This suggests to us that even in third party  
treatments, subjects were directly group-reciprocating the previous behavior of others towards  
them. The identification of group reciprocity is not clean, however, because subjects cannot be sure  
that the last partner was a different person from the current P. In later tables, we use the same  
history variables, but omit their coefficients for the sake of clarity. 
The δ coefficient on F take ×  Same group  remains almost unchanged in all these specifications, and 
is highly significant throughout for first party treatments. The final column estimates (1) using a  
tobit functional form, censoring the data at 0 and 50. Here the δ coefficient is larger, because the  
tobit specification treats the censored observations as less informative.

We include three further checks of the basic result. First, we split our data up by repetition,  
analyzing repetitions 1-4 separately from repetitions 5-8. Some behaviors, such as contributions to  
public goods games, change over repetitions in repeated experiments. Similarly, it could be that  
group reciprocity is only observed early on, and less so or not at all in later repetitions as subjects  
gain experience. If so, group reciprocity would not be an “equilibrium phenomenon”, although out- 
of-equilibrium behavior might still be interesting and important. Columns 1-2 of Table A7 estimate  
equation (1) separately for early and late repetitions. If anything results are stronger in later  
repetitions, although the difference between the (first party) δ coefficients is not significant  
(p=0.496).

The second check is to split up decisions by whether the decision-taking subject herself was in the  
same group as the other subject on her side (i.e., whether the Own same group dummy was 1 or 0).  
In particular, this might make a difference for indirect group reciprocity: subjects may group- 
reciprocate against behavior towards somebody else in their group, but not behavior towards  
someone not in their group. However, direct group reciprocity could also be affected, for example if 
feelings of group identity get stronger when 2 subjects of one group face 2 subjects of another  
group. Table A8 shows the results. Again, the split makes little difference, either for first or third

Lastly, we replace the linear specification by a set of 6 dummies, 1 each for values of F take 
between 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49 and 50. These are then interacted with Same group.The  
field literature has many more examples of negative group reciprocity –  returning evil for evil  – 
than positive group reciprocity, so we expected to see larger and more significant interaction terms  
at high values of F take. This is broadly confirmed in Table A9, which shows the results, using the  
same four specifications as Table A6.

Expectations 
There are two possible explanations of the group reciprocal behavior we observe. First, F’s action  
may affect S’s preferences, broadly defined, for example by making her feel more or less altruistic  
towards P. Second, F’s action may shift S’s expectations  about P’s behavior, without necessarily  
affecting her preferences. For example, if S wishes to take exactly as much as P, and assumes that  
participants from the same group take similar amounts, then S’s taking behavior will be affected by  
F take  when F and P are from the same group. We approach this question in two ways: first by  
eliciting expectations, second by looking at S’s behavior when she knows that P’s take is  
determined randomly by a computer, out of P’s control. 
The variable Expectations gives S’s expectations of P’s second round take, in repetitions 2 and 7,  
elicited as described above. If we re-estimate equation (1) with this variable added,  both the  δ 
coefficient and the β coefficient on F take  become insignificant in all treatments (estimations not  
shown). However, re-estimating equation (1) without Expectations, but on repetitions 2 and 7 alone, 
also shows these coefficients becoming insignificant, so the smaller dataset may be to blame rather  
than the effect of controlling for Expectations. One way to resolve this is to multiply impute the  
Expectations  variable for other repetitions. Since the missingness of  Expectations  is wholly  
determined by the repetition number, it is “missing at random” with respect to the value of  
Expectations  once repetitions are controlled for. This means that multiple imputation will be  
unbiased (Rubin 1976). Table A10 shows the results, using the same specifications as Table A6.  
Expectations is highly significantly correlated with subjects’ second round take. Indeed in the basic  
OLS regression, the coefficient is not significantly different from unity, fitting the story that  
subjects wish to match the amount their partners take. Also, the value of δ is about halved in first  
party treatments, although it remains weakly significant. This strongly suggests that shifts in  
expectations help to explain group reciprocal behavior.

because the data from repetitions 2 and 7 are not enough for a credible estimate of per-individual  
effects. F take  has a significant positive effect on subjects’ expectations. This effect appears larger  
when F and P are in the same group, but the difference is not significant.

Are these expectations justified, i.e is F’s and P’s actual behavior correlated? Table A12 examines  
this by regressing P’s second round take on F’s first round take (equivalently, regressing subjects’  
second round take on the first round take of the other subject on their “side”). Column 1 shows a  
48 

========49========

small but significant correlation between the two, which does not change significantly when P and F 
share group membership. However, column 2 shows that this result does not survive adding in time  
and session dummies, and these seem the most likely explanation for the basic correlation. We  
found similar null results within each session type (regressions not shown). Nevertheless, subjects  
might find F’s take a useful heuristic for estimating P’s take, since they can observe it, but cannot  
directly observe session effects or repetition effects. F and P’s group membership does not appear to 
be a useful heuristic in this way, since it does not affect the correlation between F and P’s behavior.

To sum up these analyses, the effect of group reciprocity is reduced when we control for subjects’  
expectations. This suggests that expectations are part of the story. There is only weak evidence that  
subjects take group membership into account when forming expectations; doing so would be  
incorrect, because the behavior of F and P is not more correlated when they share group  
49 

========50========

membership (and is not correlated at all after controlling for repetition and session). 
As stated in the main text, subjects who intend to take a large amount from the common resource in  
the second round may report that they expect their partners to take large amounts, due to a self- 
justification or false consensus effect (Messé and Sivacek 1979); this would bias our estimate of the 
causal effect of expectations. Therefore, we used an alternative approach to examine behavior when 
expectations were irrelevant. In 64 of the choices of sessions 11-12, subjects were informed  
between the rounds that their second round partner’s choice would be made by the computer  
drawing a random number from 0 to 50. All subjects, including those whose choice was made by  
the computer, were still paid as normal from these rounds. Thus, S’s expectations about P’s choice  
ought not to be affected by F’s take in round 1. We can use these decisions to examine how the  
amount taken by F affects the amount given to P, independently of any change in expectations. 
Table A13 estimates equation (1) separately for when P’s choice would be made by a human  
(Human Choice) and by the computer (Random Choice).  The coefficient on F take ×  Same group  is 
always positive for both values of Random Choice, and the difference between coefficients is never  
significant. In the fixed effects regression, the coefficients on F take ×  Same group  are not  
significant. We attribute this to the small sample size and the inefficiency of fixed effects; in any  
case, the coefficient is substantially larger when Random Choice=1. Overall, while expectations  
seem to play a role in group reciprocity, they are not the whole story.

Fairness 
Next, we examine perceptions of fairness. The pre-questionnaire contained the question “Did you  
think the quiz was fair?” Responses were on a 1-5 Likert scale. We created a Fair  dummy which is  
1 if subjects chose 4 or 5 and 0 if subjects chose 1, 2 or 3. Columns 1-4 of  Table A14 estimate  
equation (1) for random bonus sessions, adding an interaction with Fair. For clarity, third party  
treatments are omitted. The interaction of Fair  with our basic variable of interest  F take ×  Same  
51 

========52========

group  is negative, and at least weakly significant in all specifications except column 3 when history  
is included. Further analysis (available on request) shows that this loss of significance comes from  
the lower N  due to the history variables, rather than from the addition of the variables themselves.  
The sum of the coefficients on F take ×  Same group  and  F take ×  Same group ×  Fair  is not  
significantly different from 0 in any specification. It appears that group reciprocity is driven by  
those subjects who perceived the quiz as unfair.

The second quiz and the contact hypothesis  
Here we confirm the analysis of the contact hypothesis from the main text. Recall that Open quiz 2 
is 1 if the subject had previously chatted with members of other group, 0 otherwise. Here, in  
contrast to the main text, we also include an Early dummy for repetitions 1-4. This avoids a  
confound with time, since Open quiz 2  only takes the value 1 in repetitions 5-8. Table A15 shows  
the standard regressions, interacting (1) with both Early and Open quiz 2. The interaction F take × 
Same group ×  Open quiz 2  is only significant in the regression with history controls; this is likely to 
be due to the reduced N, since in other regressions the coefficient is not only insignificant but  
substantively small. Table A16 repeats the exercise, but replaces Open quiz 2 with a dummy Quiz 2  
met P, which is 1 if the subject had previously interacted with participants of P’s color during the  
second quiz. Thus it tests whether group reciprocity is specifically reduced towards members of  
other groups with whom the subject cooperated. Again, the coefficient on F take ×  Same group × 
Quiz 2 met P is not significant and does not have a constant sign.

3. Further results 
Inequality 
In this section we report some statistical analyses of further topics, which the main paper only  
briefly summarizes. Between-group inequality is closely related to unfairness, and it may be an  
important channel leading from ethnic diversity to conflict (Cederman et al. 2011) and inefficient  
public good provision (Baldwin and Huber 2010). In our experiment, subjects could observe the  
quiz earnings of F and P. We therefore examine whether high earning groups were more likely to  
elicit group reciprocity. Table A17 interacts equation (1) with F’s quiz earnings. The interaction F  
take ×  Same group ×  F earnings  is positive and significant except under the fixed effects  
specification. So, there is some evidence that high earning groups indeed received more group  
reciprocity.

Social Identity Theory (SIT) is the longest-established psychological theory of group behavior  
(Tajfel et al. 1971). It holds that individuals support their group, and discriminate against other  
groups, in order to protect the self-esteem and security they derive from their social identity as a  
group member. If we treat group reciprocity as a form of group discrimination, SIT would predict  
57 

========58========

that subjects with the strongest attachment to their own group will be most likely to group- 
reciprocate. Our final questionnaire included a set of questions derived from standard measures of  
group identity (Ellemers et al. 1999). We sum answers to these (on a 1-7 Likert scale) to create the  
variable Group ID. Table A18 interacts equation (1) with Group ID. The interaction term F take × 
Same group ×  Group ID  is significant in only two out of four specifications, although it always has  
the expected sign.

4. Participant Instructions 
Translated from German. 
Welcome to the Experimental Laboratory! 
Please turn off your mobile phones and all other electronic devices now! 
You are participating in an economic experiment. Depending on your own choices and choices of  
participants matched with you, you will be able to earn a non-trivial amount of money. For this, it is 
important that you read carefully and understand the following instructions. 
During the experiment communication among the participants is strictly prohibited, except in  
situations in which it is explicitly allowed! In case you have any questions, please raise your hand  
and an experimenter will come to you to answer your question. 
Non-compliance with this rule and with the instructions of the experimenters will lead to an  
exclusion from the experiment and all payments! 
Your decisions during the experiment will be made anonymously. Only the experimenter will get to  
know your identity, but your decisions will not be relatable to your identity. 
You will receive EUR 5 as show up fee. Additional payments will depend on your decisions and  
those of participants matched with you. Earnings will during the experiment be entitled Expected  
Currency Units, abbreviated as ECU. The total amount of ECU you gained during the experiment  
will be converted at the end, where 
1 ECU = 5 CENT (0.05 EUR) 
and be paid in cash. 
In this experiment, you and the other participants will randomly be assigned one of 4 groups: green, 
60 

========61========

orange, purple, and brown. Each group consists of 4 participants. The color of your group will be  
shown to you onscreen. During all parts and rounds of the experiment, you will see the time  
remaining for a choice in the upper right corner of the screen. The screen at the beginning of the  
experiment will look similar to the following (please note that no decision has to be made on this  
first screen): 
[THE TEXT ON THE SCREEN READS AS FOLLOWS: UPPER RIGHT CORNER: “Remaining time” 
MAIN BODY: “PART I – QUIZ 
You are in group orange. The quiz will begin shortly.”] 
The experiment consists of 2 parts. 
PART I 
Each group will play a quiz. The aim of the quiz is to answer different questions about general  
61 

========62========

knowledge. On the whole, there are 20 questions with 4 possible answers each. Each question can  
be answered individually, but you have the option to exchange information with the other members  
of your group via computer chat. This is the only allowed form of communication over the course  
of the experiment.  
The screen will look similar to the following. In the blue field on the right hand side you can enter  
your chat contributions. In the grey field above it you can read the contributions of the other  
members of your group.

(Please press enter to send your contribution)] 
For each correct answer, you will receive one point. On the whole you have 10 minutes to answer  
all questions. Questions not or wrongly answered will be evaluated with 0 points. The computer  
will add all points of each group's members. 
Your group will receive 10 ECU for each of the 80 possible points. (4 participants per group x 20  
correct answers = 80 points maximum.) 
Example: 
Assume the participants of a group answer 20, 15, 14, and 11 questions correctly. The overall  
number of points of this group will then be 20+15+14+11=60. The group will then receive  
10x60=600 ECU. 
There is however a minimum earning of 400 ECU per group, i.e. Should your group for instance  
achieve 0 points in the quiz, you will nevertheless receive 400 ECU. 
The earnings of the group will be distributed as follows: 
• 
400 ECU will be subtracted from the overall earnings and divided equally among the group  
members. These will serve as endowment for part 2 of the experiment. Therefore, every  
participant will begin part 2 with 100 ECU. 
• 
All remaining ECU will also be divided equally among the group members (partial amounts  
will be rounded up) and constitute your earnings of part 1. 
Example continued: 
63 

========64========

Let's take the 600 ECU of the example group. 400 ECU will be used for part 2 of the experiment.  
The remaining 200 ECU will be divided equally among the participants: Each participant gets  
200/4=50 ECU(=2.50 EUR) from part 1. 
After the quiz, we ask you to briefly answer three questions to the quiz. 
Bonus ECU 
[IN WINNER SETTING]: The group achieving the most points in the quiz will receive a bonus of  
100 ECU per participant. 
[IN RANDOM SETTING]: A randomly selected group will receive a bonus of 100 ECU per  
participant. 
PART II 
The second part of the experiment consists of 8 rounds, in each of which you will have to make 2  
decisions. At the end of the experiment, one  of these 8 rounds will be  randomly selected for your  
final payment. The earnings of this round only will be added to your earnings of part 1.  
In each round you will be interacting with 3 other participants. These can be of any of the different  
groups – green, orange, purple, brown. After each round the composition of each group will be  
changed, such that you need not interact with the same participants. In each round participants will  
be given a number ranging from 1 to 4, which may change from round to round. 
In each round, each of the 4 participants will have to make 2 decisions. After each decision, you  
will receive feedback on one  of the other participants' choice.  
[IN SESSIONS 11-12 THIS PARAGRAPH WAS CHANGED TO: 
In each round, principally each participant will have to make 2 decisions. In some rounds the  
computer may make some of the decisions instead of the respective participant on a random basis.]

DESCRIPTION OF A ROUND 
During each round the current participants are shown onscreen. For each participant you will be  
given information about his group membership and the amount he received in part 1.  
DECISION 1 
Participants 1 to 4 will be paired. Participants 1 and 2 are paired, and participants 3 and 4. 
50 ECU of each of a pair's participants' earnings in part 1 will be put into a joint fund. The fund will 
thus contain 100 ECU. 
Each participant of the pair may afterwards choose how much to withdraw from the fund. Both  
participants can simultaneously withdraw an amount between 0 and 50 ECU. Every ECU remaining 
in the fund will be multiplied by 1.5 and divided equally between the two (partial amount will be  
rounded up.) 
Example: 
Assume that participant 1 had withdrawn 33 ECU and participant 2 had withdrawn 37 ECU (the  
number mentioned were randomly chosen by a computer.) Then the fund would consist of 100-33- 
37=30 ECU. These are multiplied by 1.5 yielding 45, and distributed equally among the two  
participants in the pair. After rounding, each will receive 23 ECU. Participant 1 will receive  
33+23=56, participant 2 37+23=60 ECU from this decision. 
The screen will look similar to the following (please note that the numbers displayed were  
randomly drawn):

You and player 4 can both withdraw up to 50 ECU from the fund. 
The amount remaining in the fund will be multiplied by 1.5 and divided equally among you and  
player 4. 
Please indicate how many ECU you withdraw from the fund.”] 
DECISION 1 FEEDBACK 
After decision 1 every participant will be informed about exactly one choice of one of the 4  
participants. This can be the decision of the direct partner in the pair, it can also be the decision of a  
participant of the other pair. The decision will be announced as follows (please again note that the  
displayed numbers were randomly drawn):

[THE TEXT ON THE SCREEN READS AS FOLLOWS: 
“Round 1: Feedback Decision 1 
You were player 2. 
Player 1 was paired with player 3. 
You were paired with player 4. 
Player 4 withdrew 41 ECU from your and his fund. 
(The other participants may receive feedback from another decision than you do.)] 
DECISION 2 
Decision 2 equals decision 1. You are again matched with the same 3 other participants in a choice  
situation and be paired with one of them. But this can now be another participant than in decision 1.  
Again 50 ECU of each of two participants will be put into a fund, and both participants choose how  
much they withdraw from the fund. The amounts remaining in the fund will again be multiplied by  
1.5 and divided equally among the two participants in the pair. 
[IN SESSIONS 11-12 THIS PARAGRAPH WAS CHANGED TO: 
In some rounds, some players' second decision may be made randomly by the computer. This will  
be shown onscreen by the words “random decision” next to the player. In these cases, the computer  
will automatically draw a number of ECU to take from 0 to 50. Each number from 0 to 50 is equally 
likely to be chosen.  The player and his pair will be paid according to this decision, in the usual  
way.]

DECISION 2 FEEDBACK 
After the second decision, the decisions of you and the participants you were matched with will be  
shown to you in a summary. The summary will show you how much you and the respective other  
participant withdrew from the joint fund and the amount of ECU overall achieved in this round.  
(Please again note that only one of the overall 8 rounds will be randomly selected for payment.) 
The summary completes the round. In case another round follows, you will be matched with other  
participants and the procedure from decision 1 onwards begins anew. The screen of a summary will  
look similar to the following: (Please again note that the shown amounts are randomly drawn)

OTHER QUESTIONS 
During some rounds you may be asked about your expectations concerning the amount the  
participant assigned to your pair will withdraw from the fund. If this is the case, you will get the  
possibility to earn a bonus. The amount of the bonus will be calculated according to the difference  
of your expectation and the de facto amount the participant withdrew. This difference will be  
divided into “intervals of five”. If the difference is less than 5 ECU, you will receive 10 ECU  
bonus. If the difference is between 5 and 9 ECU, you will receive a bonus of 9 ECU, if it is between 
10 and 14 ECU you will receive a bonus of 8 and so on, up to a bonus of 1 ECU if the difference is  
between 45 and 49 ECU, and no bonus if the difference is 50 ECU. The possible boni are  
summarized in the following table: 
Difference  
0-4  
5-9

(ECU) 
Example:

========71========

If you believe the other participant will withdraw 45 ECU from the fund, but he only withdrew 27  
ECU, the difference between your expectation and the true amount is 45-27=18 ECU. 18 is in the  
interval between 15 and 19. You will thus receive a bonus of 7 ECU. 
The screen for an expectation will look similar to the following: 
[THE TEXT ON THE SCREEN READS AS FOLLOWS: 
“Round 2: Expectation decision 2 
You are player 4. 
Player 1 is paired with you. 
Player 2 is paired with player 3. 
How many ECU do you think player 1 will withdraw? 
71 

========72========

You receive 10 ECU if the difference between your expectation and the true withdrawal is less than  
5 ECU, 9 ECU if it is more than 5 but less than 10 ECU etc. 
Please indicate your expectation (0-50 ECU):”] 
After the experiment there will be a brief questionnaire. Please answer these questions truthfully. 
PAYMENT 
After the end of the experiment the round of part 2 chosen for payment will be announced. You will  
then be called separately and payed privately. Additionally to the ECU earnings of the experiment  
you will receive 5 EUR show up fee. You will have to sign a receipt for the money, but this receipt  
will in no way be associated with your choices during the experiment. After receiving your  
payment, please exit the lab silently. 
Do you have any questions regarding the experiment?
