Abstract 
Tis paper examines the efects of transit, documentation,  and ports and customs delays on Africa’s exports.  Te authors fnd that transit delays have the most  economically and statically signifcant efect on exports.  A one-day reduction in inland travel times leads to a  7 percent increase in exports. Put another way, a one- day reduction in inland travel times translates to a 1.5  percentage point decrease in all importing-country tarifs.  By contrast, longer delays in the other areas have a far  
smaller impact on trade. Te analysis controls for the  possibility that greater trade leads to shorter delays in  three ways. First, it examines the efect of trade times on  exports of new products. Second, it evaluates the efect of  delays in a transit country on the exports of landlocked  countries. Tird, it examines whether delays afect time- sensitive goods relatively more. Te authors show that  large transit delays are relatively more harmful because of  high within-country variation.

I. Introduction 
Earlier work has shown that delays in getting goods from the factory gate onto the  ship hinder exports more than foreign tariffs do (Hummels (2001), Djankov, Freund and  Pham (2010), and Portugal and Wilson (2009)).  This is especially debilitating for  Africa’s exports because of extreme delays.  This suggests that improving trade  facilitation in Africa would significantly boost exports.  But there are different ways to  accomplish this, as the time delay has three distinct components: documentation, transit  time, and port handling and customs clearance. In this paper, we explore whether these  delays are equally burdensome or whether one of these binds relatively more, using  detailed data on average trade times from  the World Bank’s Doing Business report. 
Bureaucratic delays are the longest, taking 19 days on average.  There is a lot of  variation across countries.  For example, it takes 36 days to process export documents in  countries such as Angola, Zambia and Niger.  In contrast, in Swaziland, it takes only 5  days to produce all necessary export documents. Bureaucratic delays may be especially  burdensome if they change often, making them difficult to predict, or if officials use them  as a means to extract rents. In contrast, documentation procedures may be less  problematic if they are predictable and can be done in advance or if there is learning by  doing.  
Customs and ports delays are the second longest, taking on average 9 days.  They are  less variable than documents.  Customs and ports could be especially restrictive if there is  a hold-up problem.  Once the goods arrive, customs and port authorities could extract  high rents by delaying goods.  In contrast, if customs and ports are reliable (but slow) or  if exporters can pay for faster service they may cause fewer problems. 
Transit costs are on average the shortest, taking 7 days.  But, again, there is a lot of  variation.  For example, it takes 37 days for the goods to be shipped from Bujumbura  (Burundi) to Dar Es Salaam port (Tanzania) and only one day within Gabon. Transit costs  may be less burdensome if economic activity has developed endogenously, close to ports  and borders when transit costs are large.  However, they may be more constraining if  there is a lot of uncertainty that cannot be avoided. 
The main contribution of our paper is to understand whether different types of export  costs affect trade differently.  We use a modified gravity equation that controls for importer fixed effects and exporter remoteness.  An important concern with this approach  is that the volume of trade may directly affect trade costs. The marginal value of

investment in trade facilitation is higher when trade volumes are large since cost savings  are passed on to a larger quantity of goods. In addition, many time-saving techniques,  such as computerized container scanning, are only available in high-volume ports.  Alternatively, increased trade volumes could increase congestion and lessen the efficiency of trade infrastructure. Thus, while more efficient trade facilitation may  stimulate trade, trade is also likely to directly influence trade facilitation. 
We use three distinct strategies to deal with the potential effect of export volumes on  export times.  First, we examine the effect of trade facilitation on trade in new products.   These are goods that have not been exported in the past.  The intuition is that trade in new  products cannot affect the quality of trade facilitation infrastructure or the bureaucracy  that is in place for exporting.  Second, we examine the effect of requirements in the  transit country on exports from landlocked countries.  This controls for endogeneity  because trade facilitation in transit countries is likely to be exogenous from the  perspective of a landlocked country.  Finally, we test whether lengthy delays have a  greater effect on exports of time-sensitive goods.  The intuition is that these products  
make up a small share of total trade so are unlikely to affect trade facilitation.1 
All three different techniques used to analyze the effect of export times of  key  components on trade values lead to the same conclusion: inland transit delays have a  robust negative effect on export values. Our estimates imply that a one day increase of  inland transit times reduces export values by about 7 percent. This effect is higher for  time-sensitive goods with respect to time-insensitive goods. In contrast, we do not find a  robust effect of documents or customs and ports on exports. 
Why would delays in one area affect trade relatively more than in other areas?  One  potential answer is uncertainty. To the extent that delays are anticipated there should be  only a small effect because documents can be prepared in advance and goods can be shipped early, with ample time for meeting deadlines.  To evaluate this explanation, we  examine the effect of within country export-time uncertainty for each type of delay on  export values.  Again, we find that an increase in inland transit time uncertainty has a  negative and significant effect on trade values. The other time components show no such  effect.  This suggests that long and unexpected delays in transit make it especially  difficult for producers to meet import deadlines.

The second and third strategies follow from Djankov, Freund, and Pham (2010).

Our results have important implications for policy. While reducing bureaucratic delays  and improving ports and customs may have small positive effects on trade, the binding  constraint in most African countries to expanding exports is inland transit.  Improving  inland transit is unlikely to be easy or cheap, but it is likely to boost exports and have  broad positive economic effects. 
Beyond these direct implications for policy, our results also contribute to the broader  debate about the influence of geography versus institutions on income.  This literature has  focused on the effects of climate versus governance on income, and potential interactions  between the two.2    We focus on a single component of income, exports, and our variables  of interest reflect geography and institutions to  different extents.  The dominance of  transit time in hindering exports seems to suggest that geography is the main culprit.  To  test this, we gather data from a GPS system on geographical distance from the port to the economic center and the estimated time of travel and include them in the regression  equation.  The difference between travel time in the GPS data and the Doing Business  data is that the former are based solely on travel distance and estimated speed of travel by  type of road (paved or unpaved).  These data do not incorporate delays due to average  vehicles, borders, security, traffic, or other road conditions.  We find that GPS distance  negatively affects exports, but GPS travel time does not.  Moreover, neither the economic  effect nor the statistical significance of the Doing Business inland transit time variable  changes when these variables are included.  This suggests that the problem for inland  transit lies in the quality and security of the roads, border delays and the efficiency of  security checkpoints, the age of the truck fleet and competition in trucking. These are  factors which are more closely linked with institutions than geography. 
The paper proceeds as follows. The next section discusses the data. Section III presents the estimation strategy.  Section IV describes the main results and robustness  checks. Section V examines the effect of uncertainty on exports and the importance of  geography. Section VI concludes. 
II. Data 
We use data on trade times  based on answers to a comprehensive World Bank  questionnaire completed by trade facilitators at freight-forwarding companies in 146

countries in 2007 and collected as part of Doing Business, a World Bank project that investigates the scope and manner of business regulations3. 
The data provide detailed information on the different kinds of costs an exporter faces  when moving his goods from the principal city to the port of exit. More precisely, the  survey asks respondents the average and the maximum times in calendar days it takes for  completing a series of export procedures. Each procedure can be classified into one of  four main categories: documentation, inland transportation, customs, and ports.  
The first category  represents the time it takes for an exporter to complete all  documentation activities such as securing a letter of credit, assembling and processing  export and international shipping certificates and realizing all pre-shipment inspections  and clearance.  
Inland transportation includes the time it takes for the merchandise to be moved from  the principal city to the port of exit, as well as the time spent arranging transport and  waiting times for the merchandise's pick up and loading into a carriage. For landlocked  countries, total transport times also include waiting times at the crossing border.  
The customs category includes the time necessary to realize the technical controls of  the merchandise. In addition, for landlocked countries this category comprises the total  time it takes from the submission of request of clearance until the completion of the inspection and clearance procedure in the transit country. Finally, the ports category  represents  terminal handling times, including storage if a certain storage period is  required,  the  waiting  times  for loading the  containers  into the  vessel  and customs  inspection and clearance times.  
An example illustrates the data. An exporter in Rwanda spends 43 days on average to  complete all requirements for shipping its merchandise abroad: 17 days each on delays  resulting from documentation and inland transit, while port and custom procedures take  respectively 6 and 3 days on average (see Figure1). 
Table 1 presents the summary statistics for each of the components representing the  total time4 necessary to fulfil all the requirements for exporting by region and regional  arrangement. The data show that across regions, documentation procedures times are the  longest. Furthermore, while getting a product from the factory to the ship is relatively  quick in developed countries, this is not the case for Sub-Saharan Africa, where all time

costs categories are on average higher compared to all the other regions. Customs and  ports procedures and inland transportation take on average three times more in Sub- Saharan African countries than in OECD countries. In addition, documentation  procedures take four times more in Sub-Saharan countries compared with developed  countries.  
The rest of the data are from standard sources.  The trade data are both from the UN  Comtrade database and the IMF Direction of Trade database. GDP and Population are  from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. Gravity variables such as country  pair distances, language and colony are taken from the  Mayer and Zignago dataset.  Country's Capital abundance information is available for 2005 and comes from GTAP 7  database. Simple average Tariffs at 6 digit level are taken from the TRAINS dataset. 
III. Methodology 
We investigate  how  three  diverse  trade costs---completing documentation, inland  transit delays, and customs and ports times—affect Sub-Saharan Africa trade volumes.  Longer time delays act as a tax on exports, especially on high-value goods, since they are  effectively depreciating during the delay. In addition, the exporter must spend capital on  the exporting process and storage/transport of the goods during the delay.  
We begin by estimating the augmented gravity equation:

,(1) 
where the i and  j subscripts correspond to the exporter and the importer, respectively. 
5 
The dependent variable represents bilateral exports from country i to country j . The  
variables of interest are the export times for transit, customs and ports, and documents.   The coefficient on each represents the effect in percent of trade of a one day increase in  that component.  We focus on variables in levels, so that the coefficients are  
                                                                                                                                                    4 
The time delays reported in the survey are probably at the lower end of the time it takes to move  the average product from factory to ship. This is because the products are chosen so that they do  not require cooling or any technical inspections based on use of hazardous materials.

There is a potential reverse causality problem in our regressions  because time-to- export variables are likely to be correlated with country exports. An improvement of  infrastructure and administrative time costs has positive effects on exports. However,  countries that export more may have higher returns to enhance local trade facilitation and  invest more in time efficient means. In addition, some types of exports processing might only be available in high volume ports. Hummels and Skiba (2004), for example, provide  evidence that trade volumes affect the timing of adopting containerized shipping and  reduce shipping costs. Finally, it might be the case that in countries with higher volumes  of trade, export procedures will be affected by congestion effects. In this case the  presence of reverse causality will lead to an underestimation of the coefficient on time  
costs. 
To control for the possibility that more trade leads to improved trade facilitation, we  investigate the effects that documentation, inland transport, and customs and ports times  have on the exports of new products.7 The intuition is that exports of new products cannot

It is important to control for remoteness in our regressions for two reasons. First, there is  evidence that a country’s trade with any given partner is dependent on its average remoteness to  the rest of the world (Anderson and Van Wincoop (2003)).  Furthermore, remoteness is correlated  with factory-to-port time delays hence not including it into the regression would produce biased  estimates of the impact of trade facilitation on export volumes.  
7 
We define new products as those that were not exported in the years 2002 2003 and 2004 and  that entered into the export market in the time interval 2005-2007.

have had an impact on the historical development of infrastructure or the type of  bureaucratic procedures in place.    In addition, because they are a very small share of total  trade they are unlikely to be associated with congestion effects. We also follow Djankov,  Freund, and Pham (2010) and use trade times of transit countries as instruments for trade  costs in landlocked countries and examine whether trade times affect time-sensitive  goods relatively more. 
IV. Results  
We now estimate the augmented gravity equation from expression (1).  The linear  regression results for a sample of 44 Sub-Saharan Africa countries are reported in Table  3.    The first column shows the results from estimation on all trade.  All three variables are  significant and their coefficients are similar, though it is somewhat higher for inland  transit.    However, this column does not deal with the problem of endogeneity of the right  hand side variables. In column (2), we report results for trade in new goods only.  The  time variables are less likely to be endogenous to trade in new goods, since this trade was  not around in the past when procedures and infrastructure for trade were developed.  The  results are somewhat different.  While the coefficient on inland transit is little changed  from column (1), the other coefficients fall considerably, suggesting that the previous  column was also picking up the effect of trade on documentation procedures and customs  and ports.  In particular the results imply that a one day increase in transit time leads to a  nearly 7 percent decline in exports. 
In the next five columns, we report robustness tests.  Columns (3)-(5) report the  results of each variable independently and total time.  This helps to deal with potential  multicollinearity between the variables and also informs us whether each variable is  significantly different from total time in its effect on exports.  Only inland transit has an  independent effect on exports.  Moreover the total effect of inland transit, equivalent to 0.067 (0.049 + 0.018), is nearly four times as large as the effect of the other components  of time.   This outcome holds after the inclusion of foreign import tariffs in the regression (see column (6)).     Including foreign tariffs also allows us to interpret a day in terms of  tariffs.  A one day delay is roughly equivalent to a 1.5 percent point reduction in all  importer country tariffs.  Finally in column (7) we report results using logs of the time

variables.  While a one percent reduction in total time leads to .5 percent more trade, a  one percent reduction in transit time leads to about a .7 percent decline in exports.  Again  only transit time is independently significant (results  for other variables are not  
reported).8 
Our second strategy to deal with the potential endogeneity of the export time variables is to use a sample of landlocked countries and use the variables for the transit country(ies)  as the instrument. This follows from Djankov, Freund and Pham (2010).9    Results are  reported in Table 4.  The first column reports OLS regression results for this sample.   With the exception of documents, the coefficients are much larger for this sample than for  the full sample (column (1) of Table 3).  One explanation is that the endogeneity problem  is greater here.  For example, when landlocked country trade is small, customs and ports authorities (which must be located in neighboring countries) give them the lowest  priority.  To control for endogeneity, we next instrument each time variable with the  corresponding variable in the transit country.  The  F-statistics of the first stage  regressions (see Table 1A of the Appendix) indicate that none of the instruments is a  weak instrument.10 Second stage regression results, with and without foreign tariffs, are  reported  in levels in columns (2) and  (3) and in logs in columns (4) and  (5).  For  landlocked countries, only inland transit has a robust negative and significant effect on  trade. 
11 
   Moreover, the magnitude from column (2) is similar to the result using all  countries and new trade (column (2), Table 3): a one day reduction in transit delays leads  
                                                       
8 
Equation (1) has been estimated excluding trade in oils and minerals from the dependent variable  to control for the surge in commodities exports that took place in some African countries during  the 2007. In addition, to account for the presence of zero trade values across country pairs, Tobit  and Poisson specifications were used. Results, available under request, confirm the fact that inland  transit has a negative and significant impact on export values. 
9 
There are two differences with this study.  First, authors use a difference gravity equation on  similar exporters. In our case this strategy is not necessary since in our regressions we are  considering only sub-Saharan Africa countries.  Second, while they use the actual times in the  transit country as instrument we use the time for the transit county’s trade in the transit country 10 
Since our regression is perfectly identified we cannot test if the excluded instruments are not  correlated with the error terms. Ïn Table A2 of the Appendix we replicate the regressions of Table  4 but this time including separate instruments for customs and ports. In this case the Sargan  overidentification test supports the validity of the instruments.  
11 
This result does not only reflect the fact these countries are more isolated. Even though delays in  inland transport are higher with respect to coastal countries (15 days versus 4 days on average),  delays in documentation  (24 days on average) and customs and ports (9 days on average) procedures are even higher for exporters in landlocked countries.

to about 9 percent more exports and a one percent reduction in transit delays leads to  
about 1.5 percent more trade.12 
In Table 5 the effects of documentation, inland transit and customs and ports times on  the exports of time-sensitive products are presented. Time delays should have a greater  effect on exports of time-sensitive goods.13 To examine the extent to which they are  hampered, we follow the methodology in Djankov, Freund and Pham (2010) and estimate  a difference-in-difference gravity equation using trade data of agricultural (processed and  unprocessed) products for which time matters the most and the least. This methodology  reduces the endogeneity problem coming from reverse causality because we control for  country and industry fixed effects. In addition, the products we consider account for only  a small fraction of trade in agricultural goods on average (less than 10 percent) so it is  unlikely that they have a large impact on establishing trade facilitation processes. 
We base our definition of time-sensitive agricultural products on the information of  their storage life (Gast 1991), which includes a range of products going from  a minimum  storage life of 2 weeks or less, such as apricots, beans, currants, and mushrooms to 4  weeks or longer, for example apples, cranberries and potatoes and canned products. We  also include goods with a very long storage life such as dry fruits with a maximum  storage life of between 6 months and one year and  canned products with a storage life  ranging from 1 to 5 years, depending on the good’s acidity. To measure time sensitivity  we use the inverse of the median storage life of each product.  
To study the joint effect of industry time-sensitivity and country time delays on  exports we estimate the following difference-in-difference gravity regression  
LnExportsik 
=αi +αk + β1(TimeSensitk )×(Inland transit timei + β3(TimeSensitk )×(Docstimei )β4(Kabundancei 
)+ β2(TimeSensitk )×(canned productk 
)×(Customs&Portstimei) )+εik 
(2) 
where α 
i 
and α 
k 
represent country- and industry-fixed effects.  The coefficientsβ 
1 
,  β 
2 
and  β 
3 
capture the joint effect of time sensitive products and respectively time delays in  inland transit, customs and ports and documentation on export values. We introduce the  
                                                       
12 
When we include the log of total time as the only trade cost variable in the regression, we get a  coefficient of about -1, the same as the  results for developing countries in Djankov, Freund and  Pham (2010), although they use a slightly different approach.

term  (Kabundance 
i 
) × ( canned productk)to control for the fact that more capital  abundant countries are more likely to have the necessary resources and technologies to  process fresh food into canned products.  
With this specification we test whether exports of time-sensitive goods are more  responsive to time delays in each of the key components of time to export than exports of  time-insensitive products. 
Table 5 presents the results for time-sensitive agricultural products controlling for  countries’ capital abundance.  We report results for countries exporting at least one  product and countries exporting at least 70 percent of the products, and also with the  variables in logs and levels.  In most of the cases, the coefficient on the interaction term  of inland transit times with time sensitivity is negative and significant. This implies that  an increase in inland transit times reduces exports of time-sensitive goods relatively more  than time insensitive goods. In contrast, interactions with documents and customs and  ports times are never significant. 
More transit delays affect the composition of trade, preventing countries from  exporting time-sensitive agricultural goods. Time-sensitive goods also tend to have  higher value, implying that some of the effects of inland transit delays on aggregate  exports results from countries with poor and not well targeted trade facilitation programs  concentrating on low-value time insensitive goods.  
In sum, we try three different ways to examine the effects of various trade delays on  trade flows, each of which should reduce the endogeneity problem inherent in the  analysis.  All three point to the same conclusion: delays during inland transit affect trade  flows to a much greater extent than delays because of documentation or at the port.  Our  results imply that reducing time spent on inland transit will significantly stimulate trade  in Africa. 
V. Why does inland transit matter more? 
All else equal, a one day delay should affect exports the same way no matter when it  occurs. However, one reason it may not is if there is more uncertainty associated with  high delays in some procedures than in others.  Uncertainty will reduce exports because it  makes delivery deadlines harder to meet.  In this section, we investigate if  greater 
                                                                                                                                                    
11 

========13========

uncertainty related to inland transport times makes costs related with documents, customs  and ports become a secondary priority relative to travel costs for existing exporters. 
We estimate the effects of time uncertainty in each component of export times for a  sub-sample of 24 Sub-Saharan countries for which there is information on the maximum  and the average number of days it takes for an exporter to complete each of the exporting  procedures14:

(3) 
We define time uncertainty as the difference between the maximum time and the  average time it takes to conclude each of the different phases representing the total time  to export. 
Results form Table 6 show a negative and significant impact of inland transit time  uncertainty on trade values, with a one day increase in this variable leading to a reduction  of exports of 13 percent (column (1)).    Or in logs (Column (2)), a one percent increase in  uncertainty leading to about a .7 percent reduction in exports. In contrast, uncertainty in  the other variables is not significant in reducing exports.  These results imply that high  uncertainty in road transport times jeopardizes delivery targets.  In addition, even if  documentation requirements take more time than inland transit, they can either be done in  advance or there may be learning by doing, such that exporters become more familiar  with the procedures and uncertainty is limited. Finally, while exporters may be able to  pay in the port to get things out more quickly, nothing can be done on the road.   
In columns (3) and (4) we include both inland travel times and inland travel  uncertainty. The coefficients reflecting both variables are significant. When we include  only inland transit (see columns (5) and (6)) in the same sample the coefficient is larger,  implying that part of the effect of transit time on exports stems from uncertainty. 
Given the dominance of transit time over the other time cost variables, in determining  trade, we next investigate whether this is a pure geography effect.  Specifically, we  control for domestic geography by using the GPS estimated distance and time based  solely on geography and type of road.  In our regressions we include road distance in km  
+ εij

from the principal city to the port of export (which is the relevant distance for which  transport is calculated in the data). In addition, we include GPS-estimated total travel  time. This variable is calculated as the total time it takes to get from the principal city to  the port of exit by assuming a speed of 40 km per hour for unpaved roads and 80 km per  hour for paved surfaces.15 Both variables enter the equation in logs. If transit is primarily a geography effect then the GPS variables should pick up the effect. 
Table 7 reports the results using the full sample. GPS distance is negative and  significant, but does not alter the effect of inland transit time (columns (1) and (2)).  GPS  travel time is negative, but is not significant and the coefficient is very small.  Column (4) shows results with all three variables, only transit time and GPS distance are significant.   Columns (5) and (6) show results excluding the transit time variable and the coefficients  of the other two variables remain roughly the same.  Column (7) shows the results in logs,  and only transit time is significant.   
The results suggest that the distance from city to port and whether roads are paved are  not the main reason for long delays in transit times. There might be other factors such as  the quality of the roads and vehicles, accidents, competition in trucking, road blocks or  border waiting times which affect the total time for an exporter to get his goods form the  factory to the port of exit.  
VI. Conclusion 
We use detailed data on key components on the time it takes to move containerized  products from the factory gate to the ship to estimate whether and how diverse trade costs  affect export volumes in Sub-Saharan Africa. An augmented gravity equation is estimated  by regressing aggregate bilateral exports on different time delay components such as  inland transit, documentation, ports and customs, and other standard gravity variables.  
To control for the possibility that more trade leads to improved trade facilitation, we  investigate the effects that documentation, inland transport, customs and ports times  respectively have on the exports of new products. Exports in these products are unlikely  to have an impact on the historical development of infrastructure. As a robustness check  we also use an instrumental variables approach to examine the effect of time trade costs  in transit countries on the exports of landlocked countries. Finally, we estimate a

No information on road condition was used in the calculation of travel time. Furthermore,  delays at the border (or otherwise) were not included.

“difference-in-difference” regression on a sub-sample of agricultural products to  determine whether trade costs affect exports of time-sensitive and time-insensitive goods, ranging from perishable products where time is most critical relative to preserved goods  such as tinned food, differently. 
Our results imply that while inland transit delays have a robust negative impact on  export values, higher times in other areas have much smaller effects in reducing Africa’s  exports. A one day increase in inland transit time  reduces exports by  7 percent on  average. Put another way, a one day reduction in inland travel times translates into nearly  a 1.5 percentage point decrease in all importing-country tariffs. In addition, this effect is  higher for time-sensitive goods compared to time-insensitive goods. We show that long  times are associated with high uncertainty in road transport, which jeopardizes exporters'  delivery targets. 
Our results have important policy implications. Export tariffs in Sub-Saharan African countries are already at a very low level. Furthermore these countries have preferential  access to markets such as the United States and the European Union. Hence, while the  benefits from a further decrease in tariffs among trading partners might be very small – or  even negative in terms of preference erosion if tariff reductions are MFN – reducing  transport times will significantly increase their exports. Trade facilitation programs  should therefore prioritize those programs directly affecting truck fleets and the  infrastructure and security of Sub-Saharan Africa’s road systems.
