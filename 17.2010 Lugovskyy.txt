Transportation Cost and Endogenous Quality Choice.*

This  paper  examines  how  the  quality  of  exports  depends  on  relative  country  size  and  its  remoteness. Specific transportation cost is the key  variable in our analysis as it gives rise to the  Alchian-Allen  effect.  In  the  model,  we  allow  for  endogenous  quality  choice  by  a  producer  serving  many  international  locations.  Higher  quality  comes  at  higher  marginal  cost  of  production,  but  can  be  delivered  at  the  same  absolute,  and  thus  proportionally  lower,  transportation cost to a given destination. Our model complements the well documented demand- side response to the distribution of transportation  costs (known as the Alchian-Allen effect) by  the  supply  side  response.  We  show  that,  ceteris  paribus,  equilibrium  quality  decreases  in  the  domestic country size and increases in remoteness from foreign markets. This happens because a  larger  portion  of  the  demand  is  affected  by  the  Alchian-Allen  effect  for  smaller  countries’  producers,  and  the  Alchian-Allen  effect  is  stronger   for  remote  countries.  We  confirm  our  predictions  empirically  on  a  detailed  product  level   dataset  of  all  exporters  worldwide  into  a  sample of Latin American importers.

1.  Introduction  
In the ‘new trade’ literature transportation cost is typically expressed in ad-valorem terms  
as a Samuelson’s iceberg.  Traditionally, this choice is justified on the grounds of analytical  
simplicity and limited empirical evidence on the functional form of transportation cost.  Recent  
empirical literature, however, clearly shows that the transportation cost is not ad-valorem. A  significant component of the transportation cost is  instead specific 
1.  Moreover, Hummels and  
Skiba argue theoretically and show empirically that  the iceberg assumption is also not  
innocuous: the specific component changes the relative prices of traded goods and shifts relative  
demand in favor of the higher quality goods consistent with the Alchian-Allen conjecture.  As a  
result, the relative demands across importers are not symmetric, and importers choose different  
relative quantities from a given exporter.  
While the Alchian-Allen conjecture is about the demand-side response to the specific  
transportation cost, this paper complements the analysis by modeling the supply-side response.    
Does the specific nature of transportation cost affect the quality of a nation’s output and exports?   
In a simple general equilibrium model of trade with  endogenous quality choice, we show that a  
specific transport cost provides incentives to produce higher quality goods, even though higher  
quality is more costly to produce, and thus higher priced.  This is due to the fact that the  
delivered relative price of the higher priced goods  is lower than the domestic one.  As first  
pointed out by Alchian and Allen, this creates an incentive to “ship the good apples out.”  We  
show that if the exports to output ratio decreases with country size, firms in smaller countries  
have stronger incentives to “grow better apples,” since a larger share of their output faces a  
transport cost.  Our theory can be anecdotally intuited by notorious examples of small countries  
specializing in high quality goods such as Swiss watches, Belgian chocolate, Swedish cars, or  
Vietnamese Kopi Luwak coffee.    
In the empirical exercise we use 6 digit HS classification product level imports into a  
sample of Latin American countries from all exporters worldwide between 1999 and 2002 to  
relate quality of exports to country size and its remoteness. We show that, ceteris paribus,  
smaller and more remote countries tend to export higher priced goods. Both findings are  
consistent with our theory of Alchian-Allen effect with endogenous quality choice. The effect of

remoteness on quality is nuanced. On the one hand, the producers in remote countries face lower  
foreign demand.  On the other hand, the relative demands are more distorted by high  
transportation cost.   
Our work contributes to several literatures.  First, it is closely related to the within- 
industry specialization literature.  Krugman (1979,  1980) describes how specialization can occur  
within increasing returns to scale industry or even  within a differentiated product.  An important  
implication of his seminal work lies in a formal description of the home market effect.  It states  
that specialization due to increasing returns can be detected by the relationship between the  
quantity of exports and the market size.  The more than proportional correlation between exports  
and size indicates that larger countries specialize  in the increasing returns sector.  Further  
pursuing this line of research, Schott (2004) and Hallak (2003) detect substantial within-product  
specialization and point out that richer countries specialize in higher quality products.  In  
particular, Schott’s results highlight considerable  vertical, international specialization even  
within the most narrowly defined product categories.  We extend this literature by showing that  
the within-product and within-industry vertical specialization depend on the country size and  
remoteness.  
Second, we contribute to the literature on the Market Potential Index (henceforth MPI)  
and trade, the foundations of which can be traced back to the seminal work of Harris (1954).   
Harris emphasized the fact that the demand for goods produced in a given location is the sum of  
demands in other locations, which are the functions  of the purchasing power in these locations,  weighted by transport costs. 
2 
  The MPI is widely used in the fast growing econom ic geography  
literature (see, e.g., Davis and Weinstein, 1999, 2003; Hanson and Xiang, 2004; Hanson, 2005),  
which is based on the idea that the firm’s decisions depend on the location and size of the firm’s  
customers and suppliers.  We are the first to decompose the MPI into domestic and foreign  
components and separate the effect of each of the components on the quality choice. In  
particular, if a single quality is to be chosen for  all markets, quality then increases in the  
domestic GDP but decreases in the GDP of the rest of the world.  Furthermore, domestic  
transportation cost increases the optimal quality, while the effect of the international  
transportation cost might have ambiguous effect on quality.     
                                                 
2 
 While until recently the market potential function  was rather ad-hoc, Fujita et al. (1999) provided m icro  foundations for the market-potential index by showing how it can be derived from formal spatial models.

Third, we contribute to the quality and productivity discussion in the heterogeneous firms  
framework.  Melitz (2003) assumes away quality differentiation, which then makes the lowest  
(marginal) cost firms the most productive firms.  Baldwin and Harrigan (2007) challenge this  
assumption and propose a variant of Melitz model in  which higher productivity firms are both  
higher cost and higher quality firms.    Empirically they show that the factory prices of exported  
goods increase with the distance to the destination.   Following Hummels and Skiba (2004), we  
show that the positive correlation between the distance to the destination and export prices can  
be due to the Alchian-Allen effect under a constant  set of exporters, rather than the self-selection  
of higher quality firms.  If the fixed cost of exporting are exporter-specific (rather than  
destination market specific), a proper test of the Baldwin-Harrigan hypothesis, stemming from a  
multi-country extension of their model, is to find the effect of the exporter remoteness on the  export prices. 
3 
     
Our model abstracts from the firm heterogeneity model because our focus is on the  
relative demands and not on the sorting of firms into exporters and non-exporters. The main  
theoretical mechanism in the models with heterogeneous firms is that the cost of exporting  
reduces the set of exporters. Depending on the relation between the profits and price, the  
exporters can be either the low or high cost producers. The nature of transportation costs and  
differences in relative demands for quality do not play a role. A notable exception is presented  
by Irarrazabal, Moxnes, Opromolla (2010) which  studies the distributional effects of specific  
trade cost. They find that the variation in distribution of firm export values is consistent with a  
fairly substantial specific trade cost.  
Recently, exporter’s quality choice has been studied by Verhoogen (2008). He analyzes  
quality upgrading among Mexican exporters to the US. The quality difference among exporters  
and non-exporters is driven by the American preference for quality and not the nature of  
transportation cost. Our empirical exercise allows for quality preference by high income  
countries, but the main focus is on transportation cost.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: theoretical framework is described in  
section 2, section 3 presents the empirical findings, and section 4 concludes.

3 
 We discuss the various alternatives of modeling th e fixed costs of exporting in greater detail after Proposition 1.

========5========

We model the quality choice of two monopolists, which produce differentiated goods  
(one each) and face demands from  i I= 1,2,...,  countries. The monopolists have to incur both  
production and shipping costs, and the chosen quality level is the same across all destinations.    
Similar to the Samuelson iceberg, the shipping prices are posted in ad-valorem terms,  however,  
the market values of the shipping prices (also referred to as “the tip of the iceberg”) are the same  
across goods and quality levels.  As a result, our model allows us to simultaneously distinguish  
between the Alchian-Allen effect and endogenous quality choice and preserve the analytical  
convenience of the iceberg transportation cost.  
   
2.1. Preferences and Production Function  
Preferences of a representative consumer in country i  are defined over a numeraire good   
n  and two types of differentiated goods,  x  and  z:  
∑ ∑ 
I I 
( ) 
σ σ− −1 1

ni 
         
e e= =1 1 
γi 
γi 
> 0, σ > 1 ,   
where λ 
e 
and  θ 
e 
are quality levels of goods  x  and  z  produced in country  e;  
ni,  xie , and  zie  are consumption levels of goods  n,  x, and  z  by a representative consumer in  country  i, where the origin of production of goods  x  and  z  is indexed by  e.   
Labor is the only factor of production and is supplied inelastically.  There are  Li  consumers in  country  I, and each consumer is endowed with one unit of labor.  The numeraire sector is  
characterized by perfect competition and constant returns to scale.  One unit of labor can produce  wi 
units of the numeraire in country  i.  The numeraire is traded at zero cost.  We assume  that the  
numeraire sector is large enough for both countries  to have strictly positive output of the numeraire.    
The introduction of the numeraire in the model simplifies the balance of trade calculation and ties  
the wage to productivity in the numeraire sector.   
The rest of the model is set from a perspective of one country, Home, indexed by  h.  For  
brevity, we mostly omit indexing producer-specific variables, since both of the producers of interest  
are located in Home. Differentiated goods are produced by monopolies.  In Home, the cost function  
is characterized by marginal labor requirements, a  and  b, which are functions of productivity  parameters ( B , , 0 α β > ) and chosen quality levels for goods  x  and  z, correspondently:4

 A similar marginal cost function was first introdu ced by Flamm and Helpman (1987) and later used by Hummels  and Klenow (2005).

2.2. Transportation Cost 
Similar to the standard Samuelson iceberg form, the  transportation of a good requires a  
fraction of the good itself, however, we deviate from assuming the “tip of the iceberg” to be the  
same across goods.  Instead, we assume the price of  transportation, calculated in monetary terms  
(at the market price of the transported good), to be the same across various goods and quality  
levels.  That is, while producers of apples or oranges pay for transportation in units of those  
goods, the dollar value of the transportation price  is the same across all types of apples and  
oranges.  The difference between the traditional Samuelson iceberg and the modified iceberg is  
illustrated in Figure 1.   
Let us set the absolute (in monetary terms) price of transportation between Home and a  
given destination  i  to be  ti.   Now, the transportation cost expressed in ad-valor em iceberg terms  will obviously depend on the price of the transported good, while the price itself might depend  
on the transportation cost.  We assume that the shippers post their (ad-valorem) prices first.  For  
a given good  x  of quality level  λ, transporters calculate the expected factory-gate price 
6 
E p  0(λ)  and for every destination  i  they post the value of the iceberg  τ λ

market value of the tip of the iceberg evaluated at  the expected price is  ti:  (3)  
(τ λ λ

( ) .  
Producers then take ad-valorem rates as given.  Similarly, to deliver a unit  z  of quality  θ ,  transporters require  
(ρ θ 
i 
( )−1)  units of the corresponding quality, such that  (4)

where E q[

 is the expected factory gate prices of good  z, quality  θ .  The two-stage price  
setting mechanism is also illustrated in Figure 2.     
                                                 
5 
 Additional multiplier  B  is added to the functional form of the marginal co st of good  z,  b, to allow for differences in  the magnitudes of marginal costs  a  and  b  in equilibrium.   
6 
 Factory-gate prices are the prices charged under z ero transportation cost.   
5  

========7========

  Consistent with the empirical literature on intern ational shipping we assume that, for a  
given exporter, transportation cost increases in the distance to the destination:  
(4)  
t ti j>  if and only if   dist dist> 
i j 
,  
where  dist 
i 
 and  dist 
j 
  are the distances from Home to countries  i  and  j, respectively.       
2.3. Market Equilibrium  
Monopolists located in Home face demands for their products from multiple countries  
and maximize their respective profit functions:

By plugging these results into equations (3) and (4) we find the equilibrium ad-valorem shipping

Note that even though we allowed for market segmentation, in equilibrium, the f.o.b. prices are  
the same across destinations, they do not depend on  the shipping charges, and the “no arbitrage”  
condition holds.  Thus, despite the specific nature  of transportation cost, the analytical  
convenience of the traditional Samuelson iceberg is  preserved.

Note that both Xi   and  τ

Nevertheless, it is a useful and intuitive result:  the  equilibrium quality level is a weighted average of transportation costs scaled by technological  parameter  α, where the weights are the corresponding quantities.  
In interior equilibrium, the ratio of marginal utilities for any two goods equals to the ratio  of their prices.  By applying this condition to the  numeraire and good  x,

2.3. Predictions  
We start by showing that the standard Alchian-Allen  effect holds in our model.  
Proposition 1 (Alchian-Allen effect):  In equilibrium for a given exporter, a larger shar e of the  
more expensive good is shipped to a more distant location.    
Proof:   By applying equation (12) to both  x  and  z, we can find the equilibrium ratio of the two  
goods shipped from a given exporter to country  i:  
Z qθσ σ− −1= = 
i i

Next we calculate how this ratio compares between destinations  i  and  j:

Now if  z  is a higher marginal cost good ( Be eθ β λ α> 
/ / 
), the ratio is greater than one if and only if  
t ti j> , which according to equation (4) is possible if and only if country  i  is further away from  
Home than country  j.  ■ 
  Next we show how the size and internal shipping co st of country-exporter affect quality.  
Proposition 2:  Quality decreases in the internal (domestic) trans portation cost and increases in  
the purchasing power of the country-exporter.   
Proof:  The first result follows directly from applying the  implicit derivation to equation (10):  
                                                 
7 
 An obvious case is for  σ τ< min ,{

but the range is much broader than that.

Intuitively, quality is a weighted average of transportation cost (scaled by α ).  When we  increase any of the bilateral transportation costs,  the direct effect on quality is positive.  The  indirect effect of higher transportation is negative for many foreign destinations since higher  transportation cost decreases the share of goods exported.  For the domestic market, however, the  indirect effect is also positive, since it decreases the share of output consumed domestically (and  thus increases the export share).

Finally, we will examine how quality reacts to the remoteness of the country-exporter.    
For this purpose we decompose the transportation cost parameter to foreign destinations, ti  ( i≠h),  into two components 
10 
. The first component, the overall exporter’s remoteness index  R, is a  
measure of remoteness consistent with the Market Potential Index measure, widely used in the  
economic geography literature (see, e.g., Hanson and Xiang 2004):   
R =

GDP Dist 
− 
i h ≠ 
i i 
    
The second component is the destination-specific multiplier, ti :  
(17)  t Rt= 
i. 
i 
Proposition 3:  Remoteness increases the average transportation co 
                  
st to foreign destinations  
which creates stronger incentives to upgrade quality. At the same time, higher transportation  
costs make goods less competitive on foreign markets, which decreases the volume of exports,  
                                                 
8 
Note that from equation (11) λ α τ*= 
∑ ∑ 
i iX Xi i i 
 , optimal quality is a weighted average of transpo rtation cost  (scaled by  α ).  Thus  λ ατ ατ> = * min ( 
i h) 
 and the expression in the round brackets is positi ve.  The denominator is  the second derivative of profit with respect to quality and is negative for the interior equilibrium.9 
The same argument as in the previous footnote applies here. 
10 
 Such breakdown of the transportation cost can aris e from  a hub-and-spoke geography.  R  is the exporter's distance  to the hub and  
t 
i  is the distance from the hub to the destination.

and thus decreases the optimal quality level.   The  total effect is ambiguous and depends on the  
parameters of the model.

Intuitively, the direct effect of remoteness (higher transportation costs to all foreign  destinations) provides an incentive to choose higher quality.  However, the indirect effect (lower  share of output devoted for exports) makes firms more oriented on domestic market and  consequently favors choosing lower quality.  The higher the elasticity of substitution, the more  sensitive foreign markets are to changes in prices and the stronger the indirect effect.   
2.5. Discussion  
As follows from Proposition 1, an exporter ships a higher quality mix of goods to more  
distant locations, even when its set of firms and quality levels are fixed.   This provides an  
alternative explanation for the “larger distance – higher export price” empirical finding of  
Baldwin and Harrigan (2007), who attribute it to the self-selection of higher quality exporters to  more distant locations. 
12 
    
  Note also that while theoretical predictions of Ba ldwin and Harrigan (2007) are based on  
the two-country model, their empirical exercise involves multiple countries.  The transition from  
the two-country model to the multiple-country empirics crucially depends on the nature of the  
fixed costs of exporting.   Using bilateral distances in the empirical part is consistent with  assuming that the fixed costs of exporting are destination-specific. 
 13 
   The set of exporters in this  
case will vary across destination.  The common fixed cost of exporting, on the other hand, will  
result in the set of exporters being constant across destinations.  It will depend, though, on the  
remoteness of a country-exporter from all foreign markets.  The empirical literature on the nature  
                                                 
11 
 For example, the expression in equation (18) is ne gative (positive) for sufficiently high (low) values of  σ. 12 
 Note that Baldwin and Harrigan assume traditional  iceberg trade barriers and according to their model, tariffs  should have the same (positive) effect on prices as  distance.  However, as shown by Hummels and Skiba  (2004),  tariffs actually have the opposite (negative) effect on prices. This supports the hypothesis that distance increases  export prices due to the specific nature of transportation cost, which triggers the Alchian-Allen effect.  13 
Theoretical examples of modeling destination-specific fixed cost of exporting include Baldwin and Forslid  (2006), Chaney (2008), and Ardelean and Lugovskyy (2010).   
10

of the fixed cost of exporting is extremely scarce,14  which prevents us from picking one of the  
alternatives with certainty.  If one, however, allows for the fixed cost of exporting to contain  
both the exporter and destination-specific components, the interpretation of the effect of  
remoteness on the average price of exports can be extended to the heterogeneous firms  
framework.  In particular, the Baldwin and Harrigan  hypothesis of higher quality – higher  
productivity will be supported if remoteness increases the average price of exports.  
3. Empirics  
3.1.  Data  
Our data sample comes from the BTI trade database for 1999-2002.  We have multiple  
Latin American importers (Argentina, Brazil, Chile,  Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay) and therefore  
many importer-exporter pairs.  We employ data on Latin American imports in each year  t,  
disaggregated by importer  i, exporter  k, product  s  (HS 6 digit data which includes roughly 5,000  
product categories) and transport mode  m  (air, ocean). We observe value, weight, duties paid,  
and shipment charges for each  i-k-s-m-t  observation. We only employ ocean shipping data, and  
hereafter drop the mode  m  subscript.  
The data on GDP per capita and population size are from the World Development  
Indicators (1999-2002) and bilateral great circle distances between capital cities of trading  
partners are from Head and Mayer (2002). 
3.2.  Empirical specification  
Our identification of quality in trade is based on the presumption that prices contain  
information about the quality. Theory links observed average prices to quality through the cost  
function, the price equation, and relative quantities.   
p p q= +X Zi iX Z X Z+ + i i i 
i i i i 
Combining the expressions for quality and cost with  the pricing equation we get the  
following expression for the average price:  
                                                 
14 
 The only known empirical test of whether the fixed  cost is destination or exporter-specific is perfor med by  Hanson and Xiang (2008).  They find that in the US movie industry, the fixed cost of exporting is rather exporter- specific, but acknowledge that the movie industry is very particular and that this is not necessarily universal across  sectors.

Close inspection of the average price equation reveals that the average price depends on cost  
shifters, quality composition, and optimal quality levels. The cost shifters enter as wage and will  
be approximated by the exporters GDP per capita. Exporter's income is likely to pick up some  
variation in the quality productivity parameter. The quality composition effect due to the  
Alchian-Allen effect works through the shares of goods x  and  z  in a way described by  
Proposition 1. We follow closely the instrumenting strategy used by Hummels and Skiba (2004)  
using distances and trade volumes to instrument for  the specific component of the transportation  
cost. The main interest of our investigation lies however in the quality choice. Theory suggests a  
set of plausible exporter specific exogenous quality shifters.  
In order to arrive at the estimating equation we use the following procedure. First, we  
condition on cost and the Alchian-Allen quality compositional effect by including exporter’s  
GDP per capita and properly instrumented transportation cost. Second, we identify theoretically  
important exporter specific exogenous size and geography shifters. Third, we construct  
specification based on a reduced form approximation. And finally, we condition on other known  
quality shifters not included in our model.  
  From equations (11) and (15) the optimal quality i s a function of the exports weighted ad- 
valorem equivalent of the transportation cost. The combined summation terms in both equations  
are a function of the relative size of transportation cost and thus are determined by quality.  
However the quality choice is driven by some factors that shift the combined term and are  
outside the firms control. Those are relative country size and geographical variables. We have  
explored these connections theoretically and verified that the size and geography variables have  
the predicted effect under a reasonable set of assumptions. With the help of some analytical  
simplifications we were able to find closed form solutions for quality and solve for the first and  
second order conditions. Unfortunately there is no closed form structural solution for estimating  
equation and therefore we rely on the first order logarithmic approximation to construct the  
estimating equation.  
  Chief among the size variables is country’s own si ze. Domestic GDP determines relative  
size of the domestic demand. Notice that in our model the effect of size is very different from the  
home market effect. Home market effect works by making a location with larger demand more  
12  

========14========

attractive for the increasing returns to scale firm. Domestic size in our model affects the share of  
the total output sold with the lower distortion due  to specific transportation cost. The basic  
identifying assumption is that the international shipping has to incur domestic shipping and the  
international shipping and thus domestic demand for  home goods is less distorted by the specific  
transportation cost. One can easily find counter examples of producers in Seattle, Washington,  
for whom shipping to Vancouver, British Columbia, is probably cheaper than shipping to Miami,  
Florida. Such situations are however more likely in  geographically large countries with larger  
domestic transportation cost.  
There is an obvious role for internal distance. A producer in a large country needs to  
incur higher transportation cost to reach domestic consumers and thus domestic consumers also  
face some distortion in relative demands due to transportation cost. We know very little about the  
exact size of the intra-national trade costs. The proxy for internal trade costs from the literature  
on home market and market potential index is the land area. A producer in a larger country other  
things being equal incurs a higher transportation cost to reach the consumers. There are  
potentially numerous ways to improve on this variable by taking into account concentration of  
population, average population density, features of  geography that may affect special  
concentration of demand. We leave those considerations for future work and choose the most  
commonly used measure. Using land area makes our results more compatible with the market  
size variables used in the MPI literature.   
Another exogenous quality shifter is the position of a country relative to the rest of the  
world's demand or its remoteness. Remoteness is simple to model but hard to measure because it  
is simultaneously a function of geography and market sizes. For example, intuitively we think  
that South African is more remote than Belgium because Belgium is close to the largest  
European countries while South Africa is far from all major large markets. A natural candidate  
for the remoteness variable from the MPI literature  is the GDP weighted distance to the foreign  
markets. This variable is inversely related to the foreign portion of the market potential index.   
Our model suggests that the remoteness affects quality in two separate ways. First, the  
market potential of the rest of the world can be thought of as the size of the foreign demand.  
Larger foreign demand means that a higher share of output is sold subject to the non-iceberg  
transportation costs. This gives producers incentive to upgrade quality. But at the same time the  
market potential of the rest of the world is also a  measure of remoteness. An exporter that is  
13  

========15========

further away from its importers has a stronger incentive to produce higher quality because the  
relative demands are more biased in favor of the high quality due to higher transportation cost.  
Consider the following thought experiment. Two countries with the same GDP have the same  
GDP of the rest of the world. However, a producer in a remote country would face a lower  
foreign demand measured by  MP 
ROW 
kt 
 than a producer in a centrally located country. Th is creates  
incentive for the centrally located producer to increase quality. The expected size on the foreign  
demand variable is therefore positive. At the same time, the producer in the remote country has  
incentive to upgrade quality due to costly transportation. In order to measure remoteness we  
scale GDP of the rest of the world by the foreign demand: GDP MP 
ROW ROW 
kt kt/ 
. If a country is  
remote, the foreign market potential differs significantly from the size of the rest of the world.  
The effect of this variable on quality is also expected to be positive. The land area captures effect  
of internal distance. A producer in a larger country would face on average a larger non-iceberg  
transportation cost than a producer in a smaller country.   
It is likely that remoteness determines development  and thus market size but at any given  
point in time we can treat them as unrelated from the standpoint of a given exporter of a given  
product. Figure 3 plots country size against its remoteness. The plot is suggestive that there is a  
sufficient amount of variation in the size and remoteness to identify separate effects.  
In our theory there is no place for importer's income. In theory we abstracted from  
importer's incomes by assumption to streamline the treatment of our main question. To hold  
other things constant we explicitly condition on the importer's GDP per capita in the estimation.  
Previous literature on quality and trade shows that  income differences are a significant  
determinant of quality. Markusen (2010) offers a detailed overview of the related issues and  
explores implications of non-homothetic preferences  for trade. Markusen sidesteps the issue of  
quality but to the extent that we rely on variation  in prices to identify quality his paper is  
relevant.  
Our theory is about cross sectional differences. We  treat time dimension with time fixed  
effects and time effects interacted with other fixed effects.  
Combining above considerations we arrive at the estimating equation:

3.3.  Results  
The results of the estimation are presented in Table 1.  The four specifications reported in  
four columns differ in the detail of the error component accounted by the fixed effects and by  
decomposition of the remoteness measure in the foreign demand and average distance  
components. The main message of the table is that we find broad support for our main theoretical  
hypotheses about the effect of size and remoteness on the price. As predicted quality decreases in  
the GDP of the domestic market: doubling the size of the domestic market decreases the factory  
gate price of exported goods by 6-7%.  There is a possibility that the larger domestic market  
allows for better utilization of the increasing returns to scale, which lowers the production cost  
and consequently the prices.  While we do not provide a direct test which would allow to  
distinguish between the two hypotheses, according to the lower production cost story, the  
proximity of the foreign markets should work in the  same direction and lower the prices.   
Instead, we find that the proximity of the foreign market increases the prices, which contradicts  
the lower cost intuition. Specifications 3 and 4 reveal a weak but significantly positive effect of  
remoteness on quality implying that the quality upgrading effect of distorted demands dominates  
the effect of smaller foreign demand. When we include both the foreign demand and the  
remoteness the effect of remoteness becomes stronger by an order of magnitude because it is  
counter acted by the direct measure of the foreign demand which has predictably a strong  
positive effect..  The presence of the Alchian-Allen effect is confirmed by the positive “Freight  
rate” coefficients.  The magnitudes are similar to the results obtained by Hummels and Skiba  
(2004).  
Consistently with the Proposition 2, factory prices  increase with the within-exporter  
transportation cost, approximated by the land area of the country-exporter. Per capita incomes of  
both importers and exporters are associated with higher quality.  
15  

========17========

4. Conclusions  
We find that when a good is exported by many countries, the average price of exports is  
lower for larger countries. We show how this link between the size and average price can arise  
from the interaction between the Alchian-Allen effect and the endogenous quality choice. The  
empirical results are consistent with our theoretical predictions.  Quality decreases in the market  
size and remoteness of the exporting country, while  increases in the internal transportation cost  
(within the country-exporter) and the size and proximity of the foreign destinations.   
There could potentially be other reasons why large countries have lower export prices.   
Large countries might choose a “high fixed cost - low variable cost” technology due to the larger  
size of the domestic market.  Alternatively, importers might consider a country of origin as an  
additional factor of differentiation, which might force producers form large countries to charge  
lower export markups due to higher competition with  similar varieties.  Unfortunately, with the  
data in hand, we are not able to test for the mechanism that lowers the export prices for large  
countries.    
A useful, though not central contribution, of this paper is the new way to model  
transportation cost that is price neutral but not quality neutral. This is a critical simplification that  
allows for analytical treatment of endogenous quality choice in the multi-country setting.   
In this paper we do not model a relation between elasticity of substitution and quality.  
The elasticities of substitution for high and low qualities are identical. This assumption of  
convenience is not always innocuous because it is the interaction between the iceberg  
transportation cost and elasticity that determine existence and relative strength of the Home  
market effect for high and low quality varieties.
