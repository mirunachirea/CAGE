Abstract: This paper provides estimates of Indian GDP constructed from the output  side for the pre-1871 period, and combines them with population estimates to track  changes  in  living  standards.  Indian  per  capita  GDP  declined  steadily  during  the  seventeenth and eighteenth centuries before stabilising during the nineteenth century.  As British  living  standards  increased  from  the  mid-seventeenth  century,  India  fell  increasingly behind. Whereas in 1600, Indian per capita GDP was over 60 per cent of the British level, by 1871 it had fallen to less than 15 per cent. As well as placing the  origins  of  the  Great  Divergence  firmly  in  the  early  modern  period,  the  estimates  suggest a relatively prosperous India at the height of the Mughal Empire, with living  standards well above bare bones subsistence.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Recently,  there  has  been  much  progress  in  reconstructing  the  historical  national  
accounts of a number of European countries during the early modern and even the late  
medieval periods (Blomme and van der Wee, 1994; Malanima, 2011; Krantz, 2004;  
Álvarez-Nogal  and  Prados  de  la  Escosura,  2007;  Broadberry,  Campbell,  Klein,  
Oveeton and van Leeuwen, 2011; van Zanden and van Leeuwen, 2011). This paper  
applies  similar  methods  to Asia,  providing estimates  of  Indian  GDP for  the  period  
before  1871. There  is  a  strong  need  for  estimates  of  Indian  GDP  during  the  early  
colonial  period,  to  assess  the  strong  revisionist  claims  about  Indian  economic  
performance  made  recently  in  the  context  of  the  Great  Divergence  debate.  
Parthasarathi  (1998)  has  made  the  most  striking  claims  for  south  India  during  the  
eighteenth century, arguing that living standards were just as high as in Britain, while  
Bayly  (1983)  has  painted  a  picture  of  a  thriving  north  Indian  economy  during  the  
eighteenth century.  
This paper presents estimates of GDP constructed from the output side for the  
pre-1871  period,  and  combines them with population data. We find that Indian per  
capita GDP declined steadily during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries before  
stabilising during the nineteenth century. As British living standards increased from  
the mid-seventeenth century, India fell increasingly behind. Whereas in 1600, Indian  
per capita GDP was over 60 per cent of the British level, by 1871 it had fallen to less  
than 15 per cent. These estimates support the claims of Broadberry and Gupta (2006), 
based on wage and price data, that the Great Divergence had already begun during the  
early modern period. They are also consistent with a relatively prosperous India at the  
height of the Mughal Empire, although much of this prosperity had disappeared by the  
2 

========3========

eighteenth  century.  Projecting  back  from  Maddison’s  (2003)  widely  accepted  
estimates  of  GDP  per  capita  for  the  late  nineteenth  century  in  1990  international  
dollars, we arrive at a per capita income in 1600 of $682, well above the bare bones  
subsistence level of $400, or a little over a dollar a day. This is more in line with the  
recent  revisionist  work  on  Europe,  which  suggests  that  Maddison  (2003)  has  
substantially  underestimated  living  standards  in  the  pre-modern  world  (Broadberry,  
Campbell, Klein, Overton and van Leeuwen, 2011). 
The paper proceeds as follows. We begin in Section II with a brief survey of  
the existing literature on India’s long run economic performance. This is followed in 
Section  III by an  overview  of  methods,  drawing  on  previous  work  reconstructing  
national  income  in  Britain  and  Europe  before  1800. Section  IV  then applies  those  
methods  to  India,  describing the  procedures  for  estimating  output  in  agriculture,  
industry and services, before aggregating the sectoral outputs into real GDP for India 
during the period 1600-1871. In Section V, these GDP estimates are then combined  
with  data  on  population  to  derive  estimates of  Indian  GDP  per  capita,  and  used  to  
compare  living  standards  in  India  and  Britain.  A  new  benchmark  estimate  of  
comparative GDP per capita in 1600 is also constructed, and used as a cross-check on  
the time series projections from the 1871 benchmark. Section V concludes. 
III. INDIA’S LONG RUN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 
India’s economic performance since the late sixteenth century has been the subject of  
enduring  controversy.  The  travelogues  of  Europeans  to  India  in  the  sixteenth  and  
seventeenth centuries often described great wealth and opulence, but it is not difficult  
to see this as reflecting their contact with the ruling classes, who enjoyed a luxurious  
3 

========4========

lifestyle with consumption of high quality food, clothing and ornaments, as well as  
imported  luxury  products.  The  middle  class  merchants  and  rich  peasants  that  
European  travellers  most  frequently  came  into  contact  with  also  enjoyed  a  
comfortable  life-style.  However,  most  travel  accounts  of  Mughal  India  and  the  
Deccan  also  noted  that  the  majority  of  Indians  lived  in  poverty  (Chandra,  1982;  
Fukazawa, 1982). The labouring classes were seen as living in mud huts with thatched  
roofs,  eating  inferior  grains,  wearing  rudimentary  clothing  and  the  use  of  footwear  
was  relatively  unknown  (Moreland,  1923:  197-203).  While  cultural  and  climatic  
conditions  may  explain  some  of  the  consumption  differences  between  India  and  
Europe, most writers were in little doubt that the average Indian lived in poverty.  
Furthermore, there is a substantial literature which attempts to chart trends in  
Indian living standards over time, starting from 1595. The reign of Akbar is usually  
seen as the peak of economic well being,  and is well documented in Abū ’l-Fazl’s  
[1595] Ā’ īn–i-Akbarī, which meticulously reported wages and prices in the region of  
Agra.  This has provided a reference point for real wage comparisons with later years.  
Desai (1972) made the striking claim that at best, the average standard of living in  
1961  was  no  higher  than  in  1595,  when  although  a  labourer  could  afford  less  
industrial goods such as clothing, he could buy more food, with the changing relative  
prices  reflecting  the  changing  productivity  trends  in  agriculture  and  industry.  The  
paper provoked some controversy over the details of the calculations (Heston, 1977;  
Moosvi, 1977; Desai, 1978). Nevertheless, most writers seem to accept the idea of a  
downward  real  wage trend  during  the  seventeenth  and eighteenth  centuries  before  
recovery during the twentieth century, a pattern first suggested by Mukerjee (1967). 
4 

========5========

This  view  of  Mughal  India  as  a  relatively  backward  economy  has  been  
challenged recently by the work of revisionist economic historians, whose work must  
be assessed within the wider context of changing views on the Great Divergence of  
living standards between Asia and Europe. Parthasarathi’s (1998) characterisation of  
south Indian real wages as on a par with English real wages in during the eighteenth  
century is strikingly at variance with the older literature, but fits well with the claims  
of Pomeranz (2000), Frank (1998) and other world historians that the most developed  
parts  of  Asia  were  on  the  same  development  level  as  the  most  developed  parts of  
Europe such as Britain and the Netherlands as late as 1800. Bayly (1983) has painted  
a picture of a thriving market economy in north India during the eighteenth century,  
which leaves a similar impression. 
Broadberry and Gupta (2006) compare silver and grain wages in Britain with  
those in India and China during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which casts  
doubt on the revisionist position, suggesting that the Great Divergence  was already  
under way during the early modern period. However, a full assessment, encompassing  
the  ruling  elites  and  middles  classes  as  well  as  the  labouring  classes  requires  the  
reconstruction of national income in European and Asian countries. This paper makes  
a start on that process by deriving estimates of GDP and population in India between  
1600 and 1870, and comparing GDP per capita between India and Britain. This is the  
first  time  series  of  national  income  estimates  for  India  before  the  mid-nineteenth  
century,  which  can  be  seen  as  joining  up  with  Heston’s  (1983)  estimates  for  the  
period  after  1870.  Our  comparative results  are  also  broadly  consistent  with  Roy’s  
(2010a) point estimates of GDP per capita in Bengal and Britain around 1800.

III. AN OVERVIEW OF METHODS 
The  first  phase  of  historical  national  accounting  focused  on  reconstructing  national  
income for a small number of relatively rich countries in Western Europe and North  
America,  and  starting  around  1870,  at  the  beginning  of  the  modern  statistical  age  
(Kuznets,  1946;  Clark,  1957;  Maddison,  1982).  A  natural  development  was  the  
application  of  this  approach  to  other  parts  of  the  globe,  and  many  non-western  
countries  now  have  historical  national  accounts  reaching  back  to  around  1870  
(Maddison, 1995). For the period before 1870, there has now been a substantial period  
of  experimentation,  beginning  with  the  study  of  British  economic  growth  back to  
1688 by Deane and Cole (1967).  
Deane  and  Cole’s (1967)  study  was  remarkable  for  the  way  in  which the  
authors  made  efficient  use  of  the  limited  range  of  processed  data  series that  were  
available at the time. Subsequent research by many authors has dramatically extended  
the  range  of  data  now  available,  with  the  revised  estimates  of  Crafts  and  Harley  
(1992) proving an important staging post. Broadberry, Campbell, Klein, Overton and  
van Leeuwen (2011) have now succeeded in producing annual estimates of GDP for  
Britain over the period 1270-1870.  
Deane and Cole’s (1967) approach now seems remarkably simple in the light  
of  the  vast  amount  of  subsequent  research.  Nevertheless,  its simplicity  and  modest  
demands on data makes it particularly suitable as a starting point for Asian historical  
national accounting in the period before the wide availability of official statistics at a  
national level. We focus here on Deane and Cole’s (1967) method for the eighteenth  
century,  where  they  constructed  an  index  of  total  real  output,  based  on  industry,  
6 

========7========

agriculture and services. The sector that was most firmly  grounded in the data was  
industry. For the export industries, such as cotton, output was assumed to grow in line  
with exports, for which abundant data were available. For home industry, production  
was assumed to move in line with the physical quantities of output of leather, beer,  
candles  and  soap.  Finally,  since  Deane  and Cole  had  no  independent  data  on  
commerce, the index of industrial output was assumed to apply also to the commercial  
sector.  It  is  not  much  of  an  exaggeration,  therefore,  to  say  that  the  whole  of  the  
industrial and commercial sector was dependent on the export data.  
For agriculture and services, by contrast, the key data series was population. 
For  agriculture,  an  index  of  production was derived  by  assuming that  agricultural  
demand grew  in  line  with  population,  which  amounted  to  assuming constant  per  
capita  corn  consumption. An  adjustment  was  then  made  for  known  imports  and  
exports  of  grain,  to  convert  demand  to  domestic  production. For  services,  even  in  
modern national accounts it is not uncommon to assume that real output moves in line  
with  employment.  Since  for  the  eighteenth  century  Deane  and  Cole  had  only  
fragmentary evidence on employment, they assumed that service output grew in line  
with population. For the government sector, however, it was possible to obtain direct  
estimates  of  output  from  government  budget  sources. Finally,  the  individual  series  
were  combined  into  an  index  of  GDP  using  weights  for  agriculture,  industry  and  
services derived from Gregory King’s [1696] social tables. 
It should by now be clear that Deane and Cole’s (1967) estimates of British  
GDP  in  the  eighteenth  century  are  overwhelmingly  dependent  on  the  path  of  
population and exports, with a minor role for government expenditure and a restricted  
7 

========8========

set of volume indicators for home industry.  It  would not be difficult to  assemble a  
similar data set for India between 1600 and 1871, and that is what we proceed to do in  
the  next  section.  However,  we  will  not  stop  there,  because  work  conducted  since  
Deane  and Cole’s (1967) study suggests  a number of ways of improving upon this  
approach, and again in ways which can be replicated with the data available for India. 
First,  subsequent  work  on  the  agricultural  sector  has allowed  for  a  more  
sophisticated  treatment  of  demand. Crafts  (1976)  criticised  Deane  and  Cole’s  
assumption of constant per capita corn consumption while real incomes were rising  
and the relative price of corn was changing, and Crafts (1985) recalculated the path of  
agricultural  output  in  Britain  with  income  and  price  elasticities derived  from  the  
experience  of  later  developing  countries.  The  approach  was  developed  further  by  
Allen (2000) using consumer theory. Allen (2000: 13-14) starts with the identity: 
QA 
rcN 
(1) 
where QA is real agricultural output, r is the ratio of production to consumption, c is  
consumption per head and N is population. Real agricultural consumption per head is  
assumed to be a function of its own price in real terms (PA/P), the price of non- 
agricultural goods and services in real terms (PNA/P), and real income per head (y).  
Assuming a log-linear specification, we have: 
lnc 
0 
P 
A 1 
ln( /P) 
P 
NA 2 
ln( /P) 
ln y 
(2) 
where  
α1 and α2 are the own-price and cross-price elasticities of demand, β is the  
income elasticity of demand and α0 is a constant. Consumer theory requires that the  
own-price, cross-price and income elasticities should sum to zero, which sets tight  
constraints on the plausible values, particularly given the accumulated evidence on  
elasticities in developing countries (Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980: 15-16, 60-82). 
8 

========9========

For early modern Europe, Allen (2000: 14) works with an own-price elasticity  
of -0.6 and a cross-price elasticity of 0.1, which constrains the income elasticity to be  
0.5.  Allen  also  assumes  that  agricultural  consumption  is  equal  to  agricultural  
production.  For  the  case  of  India,  where  more  limited  information  is  available,  we  
implement a more limited version using the grain wage (the daily wage divided by the  
price of grain) and an assumed income elasticity of 0.4.1 
Second,  
a number of authors have used the share of the population living in  
towns as a measure of the growth of the non 
-agricultural sec 
tor. This approach began  
with Wrigley (1985), and has recently been combined with the demand approach to  
agriculture to provide indirect estimates of GDP in a number of European countries  
during  the  ear 
ly  modern  period  (Malanima,  2011 
;  Álvarez 
-Nogal  and  
Pr ados  de  la  
Escosura, 2007 
; Pfister, 2008 
). With the path of agricultural output  
(qa) derived using  
equations (1) and (2), overall output (q) is derived as: 
q 
1 
qa q na 
/q 
(3) 
where  the  share  of  non-agricultural  output  in  total  output  (qna/q)  is  proxied  by  the  
urbanisation rate. The approach can be made less crude by adjusting the urbanisation  
rate to deal with rural industry or agricultural workers living in towns. 
IV. ESTIMATING INDIAN NATIONAL INCOME 
                                                  
1 
One way to justify this would be if the cross-price elasticity is zero and real income is the wage  divided by the overall price level. The own-price elasticity must then equal the negative of the real  wage elasticity. But then the overall price level used to deflate the wage cancels out with the overall  price level used to deflate the grain price, leaving a single term in the grain wage. The slightly lower  income elasticity of 04 is consistent with estimates for staple grains in poor societies (Bouis, 1994). 
9 

========10========

In  this  section  we  derive  estimates  of Indian  GDP  by  sector,  following  the  basic  
approach of Deane and Cole (1967), but incorporating demand effects into agriculture  
and urbanisation effects into services. 
1. Population 
The  first  full  census  of  India  was  conducted  non-synchronously  between  1867  and  
1872, but is usually presented as the first decennial census for 1871. This provides the  
starting point of our population estimates in Table 1. For the period 1801-1871, we  
use the decadal estimates of Mahalanobis and Bhattacharya  (1976), who assembled  
information collected by the British for the three Presidencies of Bengal, Madras and  
Bombay, and supplemented this with assumptions about the rate of population growth  
in  the  non-enumerated  regions. For  earlier  years,  we  have  drawn  on  the  estimates  
collected together by Visaria and Visaria (1983: 466), based on a 50-year frequency.  
We use the Bhattacharya estimates for 1751-1801, the mean Datta estimates to link  
1600  and  1750,  the  Wilcox  estimates to  link 1600  with  1650,  and  log-linear  
interpolation for 1700.  
Given the hybrid nature of the series projected back from the 1871 benchmark,  
it is worth noting that Habib (1982a: 164-166) provides a useful cross-check for the  
absolute  population  level  in  1600,  on  the  basis  of  three  alternative  methods  of  
estimation. One  approach,  based  on  the  cultivated  area,  yields  an  estimate  of  142  
million, while an alternative approach based on land revenue suggests a population of  
144.3 million. A third method, based on the size of armies, suggests a population of  
140  to 150  million.  All  three  estimates  are  broadly  consistent  with  our  population  
figure of 142 million in 1600. 
10 

========11========

Indian  population  grew  at  an  annual  rate  of  0.22  per  cent  over  the  whole  
period 1600-1871. However, growth was faster in the nineteenth century than during  
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The effect of famines is easier to identify in  
the  nineteenth  century  because  of  the  higher  frequency  of  observations,  but  crises  
were equally prevalent in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. 
2. Agricultural output 
Rather  than  following  Deane  and  Cole’s  (1967)  assumption  of  constant per  capita  
grain  consumption,  we  estimate  agricultural  consumption  using  a demand  function 
which allows consumers to respond to wage and price changes. Table 2 thus sets out  
an index of wages for unskilled labourers in India, together with indices of grain and  
cloth prices. The wage and grain price series are derived from Broadberry and Gupta  
(2006)  for  the  seventeenth  and  eighteenth  centuries,  supplemented  by  additional  
information for the nineteenth century from Mukerjee (1967), and provide the most  
widely  used  index  of  real  wages  in  India,  the  grain  wage.  Although  the  precise  
magnitude of the fall in the grain wage from its high level in the early seventeenth  
century is a matter of controversy, most scholars have acknowledged the downward  
trend  (Desai,  1972;  1978;  Moosvi,  1973;  1977;  Heston,  1977). Furthermore,  it  is 
interesting  to  note  that  the  scale  of  the  Indian grain wage  decline  is  similar  to  that  
suggested  by van  Zanden  (1999)  and Allen  (2001)  for  early  modern  southern  and  
eastern Europe, where a long period of decline steadily eroded the post-Black Death  
doubling of real wages. 
11 

========12========

The cloth price series are derived from the records of the East India Company  
for  the  period  before  1833  and  from  Parliamentary  Papers  for  subsequent  years  
(Chaudhuri, 1978; Bowen, 2007; Twomey, 1983; Sandberg, 1974). Note that the cloth  
wage  declined  by  less  than  the  grain  wage  during  the  seventeenth  and  eighteenth  
centuries  and  increased  substantially  during  the  nineteenth  century  as  the  price  of  
cloth declined relative to the price of grain. As a result, the real consumption wage  
declined by much less than the grain wage, which has often been taken as an easily  
available index of living standards. Our real consumption wage is a weighted average  
of the grain wage and the cloth wage, with a weight of two-thirds given to former,  
consistent with budget studies for India during this period (Allen, 2009). 
An  index of  agricultural  production  for  the  domestic  market  is  provided  in  
Table 3A, derived from the grain wage with the income elasticity of demand set at  
0.4. The  growth  of  demand  caused  by  population  expansion  was  tempered  by  the  
declining  grain  wage,  so  that  total  agricultural  consumption increased more  slowly  
than population. This is consistent with a Malthusian picture of diminishing returns to  
food production.  
Turning to the impact of foreign trade, however, we see that the diminishing  
returns to food production were offset in the nineteenth century by the expansion of  
non-food  agricultural  crops.  Table  3b  provides  an  index  of  agricultural  exports, 
derived  by  obtaining  the  value  of  total  exports  in  current  prices  and  the  share  of  
agricultural  crops  from  Chaudhuri  (1983),  and  deflating the  resulting  series  of  
agricultural exports in current prices by the agricultural price index from Mukerjee  
(1967).  For  the  seventeenth  and  eighteenth  centuries,  we  have  assumed  that  
12 

========13========

agricultural exports grew in line with domestic agricultural production. Weights for  
the export and domestic components of agricultural production in 1871 are obtained  
by projecting the share of exports in total production in 1901 back in time. Although  
the share of exports in total agricultural production in 1871 was only around 10 per  
cent,  agricultural  exports  nevertheless  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  path  of  total  
agricultural  production  in  the  nineteenth  century,  as  exports  of  crops  such  as  raw  
cotton,  opium  and  indigo  offset  the diminishing  returns  in  food  production. As  we  
shall  see  in  the  next  section,  the  export  of  these  non-food  crops  also  offset  a  
substantial decline in exports of cotton piece goods, as India’s comparative advantage  
shifted away from manufactures. 
3. Industrial Output 
Table 4 sets out the data for estimating the output of industry oriented  towards the  
home market. As with agriculture, we have used a demand function approach, which  
can  be  cross-checked  against  other  estimates  of  per  capita  cloth  consumption  
available for the nineteenth century. We have allowed cloth consumption per capita to  
move in line with the cloth wage from Table 2 and an assumed income elasticity of  
demand of 0.5. The absolute level of cloth consumption per capita in the base year of 
1871 has been set at 8.2 square yards from Roy (2011b). Roy also provides estimates  
of cloth consumption per capita for a number of other years, and our figure of 0.5 for  
the  income  elasticity  of  demand  has  been  chosen  to  be  consistent  with  these  
estimates.2 We find per capita consumption of cloth  
fell between 1600 and 1811 as  
wages  failed  to  keep  up  with  rising  cloth  prices 
.  However,  after  1811  the  price  of  
                                                  
2 
Roy (2011b) reports figures of 8.0 square yards for 1860, 5.7 square yards for 1840, 5.1 square yards  for 1820 and 5.2 to 6.7 square yards for 1795. 
13 

========14========

cloth  fell  sharply  while  money  wages  continued  to  increase.  Per  capita  cloth  
consumption then increased with the rising cloth wage.  
Nevertheless,  domestic  production  did not  move  simply  in  line  with  
consumption after  1801  because  of  the  growing  penetration  of  the  Indian  home 
market by imports from Britain, shown in Table 4B. In line with Roy (2011b), we find  
that  the  growing  import  penetration  was  consistent  with  a  slight  upward  trend  in  
domestic  production  for  the  home  market,  because  of  population  growth.  This  
provides  quantitative  support  for  the  interpretation  offered  by  Morris  (1968) that  
colonialism did not lead to an absolute decline of the traditional Indian cotton textile  
sector. 
However, before we can address fully the issue of deindustrialisation, we need  
to quantify developments in the export section of Indian industry. Table 5 and Figure  
1  provide  data  on Indian  textile  exports  to Britain for  the  period  1665-1834 from  
Chaudhuri  (1978)  and  Bowen  (2007).  Although  we  lack  data  for  Indian  exports  to  
other countries, it is possible to make an allowance for the growing share of Britain as  
an export destination using data on regional shares of bullion inflows to India from  
Haider (1996: 323), since the purchase of  Indian textiles was financed largely  with  
silver. The data in Figure 1 capture the healthy state of the Indian cotton textile export  
industry  during  the seventeenth  and  eighteenth centuries. After  1801,  however, the  
industry went into decline, particularly with the growing British competition after the  
end  of  the  Napoleonic  Wars  (Broadberry  and  Gupta,  2009).  Table  6 charts  the  
continued  decline  of  the  Indian  textile  export  industry until  the  establishment  of  a  
modern factory based industry in Bombay during the 1850s (Morris, 1983: 572-583;  
14 

========15========

Farnie, 2004: 400-405). The current price data for the period 1851-1871 have been  
converted  to  constant  prices  using  an  index  of  imported  cotton  cloth  prices  from  
Sandberg (1974: 260), which tracks well the price of domestically produced cloth for  
overlapping years from Mitra (1978: 207). During this period, the price of cloth rose  
by  just  6.3  per  cent,  so the  deflation  makes  only  a  small  difference  to  the  nominal  
data. 
Returning  to  the  issue  of  deindustrialisation,  we  have  to  balance  a  sharp  
absolute decline in export industry against a small upward trend in domestic industry.  
Despite  the  relatively  small  weight  of  the  export  section  by  1871,  the scale  of  the  
decline  was  so  catastrophic  that  the  net  effect  was  an  absolute  decline  in  Indian  
industrial production in the first three decades of the nineteenth century, rather than  
just  a  reduction  in the  share  of  industry  in  economic  activity,  consistent  with  
Clingingsmith  and  Williamson’s  (2008)  definition  of  strong  rather  than  weak  
deindustrialisation. Nevertheless, the scale of Indian deindustrialisation shown here is  
in  line  with  that  suggested  by  Twomey  (1983)  rather  than  the  more  catastrophic  
domestic industrial collapse claimed by Bagchi (1976) on the basis of evidence from  
the state of Bihar.  
4. The service sector 
For domestic services and housing, Deane and Cole (1967) assumed growth in line  
with population. However, recent work on the long run development of the European  
economy  suggests  that  service  sector  growth  moves  more  closely  in  line  with  the  
urban  population (Broadberry,  Campbell,  Klein,  Overton  and  van  Leeuwen,  2011).  
Estimates of the urban share of the population in India are presented in Table 7 for  
15 

========16========

benchmark years, suggesting a decline in the share of the population living in cities of  
more  than  5,000  inhabitants.  Multiplying  the  population  by  the  urban  share,  with  
interpolation between benchmark  years,  yields an estimate of the urban  population,  
which remained fairly stable despite the growing total population. 
For government services, Deane and Cole (1967) used current expenditure on  
government  services  from  the  budgetary  accounts  deflated  by  a  price  index.  In  the  
case of India, we can only measure the size of the government sector from the revenue  
side,  but it is  reasonable  to  assume  that  government  expenditure  moved broadly  in  
line  with  revenue  at  least  over  the  periods  of  time  between  the  observations  
considered  here (half  centuries  during  the  Mughal  period  and  decades  during  the  
British period). Current price revenues are assembled from the sources listed in the  
notes to Table 8 and deflated using the weighted average of the grain price and cloth  
price  indices  presented  in  Table 2. Since  the  territory  from  which  the  revenue  was  
collected  varies,  we  have  converted  the  revenues  to  a  constant  territorial  basis  by  
using  real  revenue  per  square mile  as  our  indicator  of  the  size  of  the  government  
sector. Real government revenue per square mile in Table 8 fell as the Mughal Empire  
declined before increasing again under British rule during the nineteenth century, but  
surpassing  the  peak  revenue  (at  the  time  of  Akbar)  only  during  the  mid-nineteenth  
century. Note  that  the  revenue  per  square mile  was  at  its  low  point  in  the  mid- 
eighteenth  century  whether  viewed  from  the  declining  Mughal  or  the  rising  British  
perspective. 
5. Sectoral shares 
16 

========17========

To aggregate the time series for output in each of the major sectors into a total real  
output  index,  we require  value  added  weights.  The  earliest  sectoral  value  added  
weights  for  India  are  for  1900/01  from  the  work  of  Sivasubramonian  (2000).  
However,  these  can  be  projected  back  to  circa  1871  using  changes  in  employment  
structure,  following  the  procedure  used  by  Hoffmann  (1965:  389)  for  Germany.  
Essentially,  this  involves  assuming  that  the  sectoral  distribution  of  value  added  per  
employee  in  1900/01  acts  as  a  good  indicator  of  the  sectoral  distribution  of  value  
added per employee in 1871.  
The sectoral weights for India circa 1871 are set out in Table 9. The largest  
sector was agriculture, and industry was largely geared towards the domestic market.  
Commerce accounted for 5.5 per cent of GDP, but is combined here with industry.  
Government,  domestic  services  and  housing  together  accounted  for  the  remaining  
10.3 per cent of GDP. 
6. Total real output 
Table 10 sets out the time series for all the major sectors and the aggregate output or  
gross domestic product (GDP) index obtained using the 1871 sectoral weights from  
Table  9.  Industry  and  commerce grew  rapidly  between  1650  and  1801,  driven  
particularly by exports. Agriculture also expanded, but less rapidly. Since agriculture  
was the largest sector, the growth of total output was also quite modest before 1801.  
Total  output  stagnated  between  1801  and  1841  as  modest  agricultural  growth  was  
offset  by  deindustrialisation.  There  was  a  return  to  modest  total  output  growth  
between  1841  and  1871  as  industrial  growth  returned and  agricultural  growth  
accelerated.  
17

V. PER CAPITA GDP 
1. Time series projections 
The GDP series from Table 10 can be combined with the population data from Table  
1 to  establish  in  Table  11  the  path  of  GDP  per  capita  in  India.  Per  capita  GDP  
declined during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries before stabilising during the  
nineteenth  century. Table  12 puts  India’s  per  capita  GDP  performance  in  an  
international  comparative  perspective.  Benchmarking  on  the  comparative  India/GB 
per capita GDP level for 1871 from Broadberry and Gupta (2010), we see that India’s  
comparative position deteriorated from a GDP per capita of more than 60 per cent of  
the British level in 1600 to just 14.5 per cent by 1871. The relative decline occurred  
fairly steadily throughout the period. 
Table 13 converts the GDP per capita information in index number form from  
Table 12 into absolute levels of 1990 international dollars, as has become standard  
since  the  work  of  Maddison  (1995).  This  enables  us  to  gauge how  far  above  bare  
bones subsistence India was. The World Bank’s “dollar-a-day” definition of poverty  
suggests  a  per  capita  income  level  of  around  $400  as  a  minimum,  and  Maddison  
(1995) finds a number of third world countries at this level in the modern world. Note,  
however,  that  Mughal  India  was  well  above  this  level.  Although  some  decline  had  
occurred  by  the  mid-eighteenth  century,  it  was  only  during  the  early  nineteenth  
century that Indian per capita incomes fell close to bare bones subsistence. 
Tables 12 and 13 have important implications for the debate over the  Great  
Divergence. First, Parthasarathi (1998) uses a comparative real wage study of Britain  
18 

========19========

and  India to support the “California School” view that living standards in the most  
developed parts of Asia were on a par with the most developed parts of Europe as late  
as the  end  of  the  eighteenth  century  (Frank,  1998;  Pomeranz,  2000).  The  evidence  
presented  in  Table  12,  however,  suggests  that  Indian  living  standards were  already  
substantially below the British level during the seventeenth century. This supports the  
view  of  Broadberry  and  Gupta  (2006)  that  the  Great  Divergence  was  already  well  
underway during the early modern period.  
Second,  although  Table  13 provides  evidence  of  a  prosperous  India  at  the  
height  of  the  Mughal  Empire  at  the  time  of  Akbar,  much  of  this  prosperity  had  
disappeared  by  the  eighteenth  century.  However, with  per  capita  incomes  of more  
than 600 international dollars in 1990 prices, India was still sufficiently prosperous in  
the  early  eighteenth  century  to  be  consistent  with  the  scale  of  market  activity  
described by Bayly (1983). It is only by the beginning of the nineteenth century that  
most Indians were reduced to what Allen (2009) calls “bare bones” subsistence. 
2. A cross sectional benchmark check 
The  results  in  Tables  12  and  13  are  based  on  time  series  projections  from  a  
benchmark estimate of comparative GDP per capita levels in 1871. This potentially  
raises  serious index  number  problems,  so  it  is  helpful  to  calculate  an  additional  
benchmark  estimate for  comparative  GDP  per  capita  levels  in  1600 to  check  for  
consistency with the levels suggested by the time series projections. Although Prados  
de la Escosura (2000) and Ward and Devereux (2003) claim that these index number  
problems are serious enough to call into question the whole validity of the time series  
projection  methodology,  Broadberry  (1998;  2003;  2006)  finds  broad  consistency  
19 

========20========

between time series projections and direct benchmarks in a number of detailed case  
studies during the period since the mid-nineteenth century. This is the first study to  
extend  this  methodology  back  to  the  early  modern  period,  enabling  us  to  confirm  
Broadberry’s  (2006)  pragmatic  conclusion  that  although  index  number  problems  
exist,  with  careful  treatment  of  the  data  it  is  still  possible  to  bring  time  series  
projections and direct benchmarks together to tell a consistent story. 
Nominal GDP data for the Mughal Empire circa 1600 have been constructed  
by Moosvi (2008), built up on a sectoral basis. The total GDP of 22,387 million dams  
has been converted to rupees and divided  by the population, obtained by applying  
Moreland’s  [1923]  ratio  of  60  per  cent  of  the  total  Indian  population  to  Habib;s  
(1982a)  figure  of  142  million,  used  here  in  Table  1.  Dividing  nominal  GDP  by  
population results in a figure of Rs 6.57 for GDP per capita in Mughal India. Nominal  
GDP and population data for England are taken from Broadberry, Campbell, Klein,  
Overton  and  van  Leeuwen  (2011),  yielding  a  GDP  per  capita  figure  of  £5.66.  
Comparing the Mughal and English GDP per capita figures at the silver exchange rate   
of £1 = Rs 8 yields an Indian per capita GDP figure in 1600 that was just 14.5 per  
cent of the English level. This is broadly in line with Broadberry and Gupta’s (2006)  
result that the Indian silver wage was just 21 per cent of the English level at the end of  
the sixteenth century.  
However, Broadberry and Gupta (2006) also noted that at the same time, the  
Indian grain wage was 83 per cent of the English level. Comparing the price of wheat  
in India with the price of wheat in England yields a purchasing power parity (PPP) of  
£1 = Rs 1.63, a long way from the silver exchange rate. Using the wheat price PPP  
20 

========21========

rather  than  the  silver  exchange  to  compare  Indian  and  English  per  capita  incomes  
yields a much smaller difference, with Indian GDP per capita now 71.2 per cent of the  
English  level.  This  is  much  closer  to  the  time  series  projection  in  Table  12,  where  
Indian GDP per capita was 61.5 per cent of the British level. Allowing for differences  
in territorial units (Mughal Empire versus India and England versus Great Britain) and  
smaller deviations from PPP for other prices suggests a broad consistency between the  
time series projections and the 1600 benchmark. 
VI. CONCLUDING COMMENTS 
This paper provides estimates of Indian GDP constructed from the output side for the  
pre-1871 period, and combines them with population estimates to track  the path of  
living standards. Indian per capita GDP declined steadily during the seventeenth and  
eighteenth centuries before stabilising during the nineteenth century. As British living  
standards increased from the mid-seventeenth century, India fell increasingly behind.  
Whereas in 1600, Indian per capita GDP was over 60 per cent of the British level, by  
1871 it had fallen to less than 15 per cent. 
These estimates cast further doubt on the extent of the recent revisionist work  
which seeks to date the origins of the Great Divergence of living standards between  
Europe  and  Asia  only  after  the  Industrial  Revolution  (Frank,  1998;  Parthasarathi,  
1998; Pomeranz, 2000). The GDP per capita data, as well as the wage and price data  
surveyed by Broadberry and Gupta (2006), suggest strongly that the Great Divergence  
had already begun during the early modern period. They  are also consistent with a  
relatively prosperous India at the height of the Mughal Empire, although much of this  
prosperity had disappeared by the eighteenth century. Nevertheless, India did not sink 
21 

========22========

close  to  the  bare  bones  subsistence  level  of  living  standards  before the  early  
nineteenth century.

Price of Rs 0.30 per  man of 55.32 lb is equal to Rs 0.005424 per lb (Heston, 1977: 393); English wheat  price of 32 s per quarter of 480 lb from Mitchell (1988: 754) is equal to £0.00333 per  lb. An Indian price of Rs 0.005424 per lb and an English price of £0.00333 per lb  yields a wheat price PPP of £1 = Rs 1.63.
