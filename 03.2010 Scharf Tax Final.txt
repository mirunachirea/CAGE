Abstract 
This paper uses a survey-based approach to test alternative methods of channeling tax  relief to donors –  as a  tax rebate for the donor or as a matched payment to the receiving  charity. On accounting grounds these two are equivalent but, in line with earlier experimental  studies, we find that gross donations are significantly more responsive to a match change than  to a rebate  change . We show that the difference can largely be explained by the fact that a  majority of donors do not adjust their nominal donations in response to a change in subsidy.  This evidence adds to  the growing empirical literature suggesting that consumers may not  react to tax changes. In the case of tax subsidies for donations, this has implications for policy  design – for the UK a match-based system is likely to be more effective  at increasing mon ey  going to charities.

Introduction 
The majority of developed countries offer government support to charities in the form of  tax relief for private donations. Most offer a tax rebate – either deductions from taxable  income or tax credits granted at the marginal rate of income tax; some countries,  including the  UK, al so offer a match element, i.e. charities can claim tax relief on  donations at an income-tax equivalent rate.  
One of the aims of offering tax relief –  whether through a rebate or a match  –  is to  encourage donations  by lowering the “price ”  of giving to char ity. Empirical evidence on  the responsiveness of giving to changes in the tax-price is, however, mixed: early studies  suggested the price elasticity was  negative and greater than unity in absolute value  (see  Clotfelter, 1985, Steinberg, 1990, and Triest, 1998), but more recent studies found that,  after correcting for short-term price effects, tax-price elasticities were  significantly  smaller  than this in absolute terms .1 
Recent experimental evidence has cast doubt on the idea that there is a single price  elasticity, pointing  to a possible effect of the  form  in which tax relief is offered.  Specifically, lab and field experiments have shown that offering donors a match has a  bigger effect on the total amount of money going to the charity than offering a rebate of  equivalent value (Eckel and Grossman, 2003 and 2008).  Eckel and Grossman suggest,  but do not test, one possible explanation that a match may create a warmer glow for  consumers since it is associated with a co-operative frame (Bénabou and Tirole, 2006)  as opposed to the reward frame of the rebate.  
For policy-makers, this finding is potentially important since it suggests that directing  tax relief through a match rather than a rebate may be more efficient in terms of  increasing donations –  but this co nclusion is tempered by the fact that the experiments  were not carried out in relation to fiscal incentives, but to incentives offered by  individual charities.  Understanding  exactly why donations respond more to a match than  to a rebate is also important for policy design.

Most studies are US based and exploit changes in rebate rates for itemizers. Randolph (1995) uses panel  data to find a long-run price elasticity of giving of -.51. Using a longer but similar panel to that used by  Randolph but a different estimation technique, Auten, Sieg and Clotfelter  (2002), arrive at the  
significantly higher estimate of -1.26. More recently, Bakija and Heim (2008) find a long-run value of -.7  –close to Randolph's estimate. Field experiments  studying the responses to variations in the match rate  offered on donations to individual causes have also found that donations respond to whether or not there is  a match but not the size of the match (Karlan and List, 2007;  Huck and Rasul, 2009).

The first contribution of this paper  is  explicitly to  test the responsiveness of donations to  changes in match and rebate incentives offered through the tax system. The UK makes an ideal case study because the main scheme through which individuals get tax relief on  their donations –  known as Gift Aid  –  has both a match and rebate element for higher - rate taxpayers.2 Looking at the responsiveness of donations in relation to fiscal  incentives is important since consumers may respond differently to changes in tax  incentives than to changes in giving incentives for a single charity –  the focus of  recent  field experiments (see Karlan and List, 2007, Eckel and Grossman, 2008, Huck and  Rasul, 2009).  There are many reasons why the response to tax  incentives may be  different, including possible substitution effects associated with single charity  incentives, since the relative prices of giving to different charities change; consumers  may also interpret the offer of a match or rebate as a quality signal for a particular  charity.  
Our results show that, for tax incentives,  the  match elasticity is significantly greater than  the rebate elasticity.  This  finding is  in line with the earlier experimental studies.  We also  show that this difference holds for a number of sub-groups, including those who reclaim  the rebate, those with a higher level of understanding of tax incentives for giving and  those who give substantial amounts to charity (more than £40,000 a year).  
We do, however,  find some differences with the results of the single -charity  experimental studies. We find that both gross donations (how much the charity gets,  including the value of tax relief) and nominal donations (how much the donor gives out  of net-of-tax income) respond to changes in the match rate. This is in contrast to Karlan  and List (2007) and Huck and Rasul (2009) who find that nominal donations respond to  the presence  of a match but not  to the size  of the match. 
The second contribution of the paper is to shed light on the underlying reason for why  donations respond more to the match than to the rebate. We  show that the difference can  be largely attributed to the fact that the majority of donors do not adjust their nominal  donations (i.e. their donations out of net-of-tax income) in response to either a change in  the match or a change in the rebate. Total donations received by charities (i.e. gross of  tax relief) therefore adjust more to a change in the match than they do to a change in the

 The UK tax system has a basic marginal tax rate of 20% on earnings between £6,475 and £43,875 (2009 - 
10 rates) and a higher marginal tax rate of 40% on earnings above this. Median earnings in 2009 were  
£20,801.

rebate.3  Among those who do adjust their nominal donations, we cannot reject that the  match and rebate elasticities are the same.  
Our finding that most donors do not adjust their nominal donations in response to a  change in tax is consistent with other recent evidence that many consumers do not fully  optimize with respect to tax-inclusive prices (Chetty et al., 2009; Finkelstein, 2009). In  that literature, individuals respond or do not respond to a tax, rather than a subsidy as in  our case, and observed choices are made in terms of quantity demanded, rather than  expenditures as in our case. Nevertheless our findings are broadly in line with those  studies in that a large proportion of donors appear not to process the change in subsidy  even when all the relevant information is available to them. 
For policy-makers the finding that gross donations are more responsive to a match than  to a rebate suggests that, for a given total amount of public funding available to support  private donations, shifting tax relief away from a rebate system and towards a match  system would result in a higher volume of total donations going to charity –  at least in  the short run.  We  conclude the paper by showing for the UK that it would be possible to  introduce a cost-neutral change in the system of tax relief that increases the total amount  of funding for charities. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2  describes the relevant features of  the UK system of tax relief on donations. Section 3 presents our survey design and  section 4  presents the main findings . Section 5 explores heterogeneity of responses  across donors. Section 6 discusses the implications of our results for policy.

Gift Aid in the UK 
Unlike the US, where tax subsidies for donations are in the form of a deduction, the  main scheme for providing tax relief on donations in the UK offers a match subsidy on  donations made by all taxpayers through the scheme, combined with an additional rebate  subsidy for higher rate taxpayers.  
The scheme, known as Gift Aid, works in the following way: individuals donate to  charity out of their net-of-tax income.4  The charity can reclaim tax relief on donations

 If nominal donations are unchanged then th e elasticity of gross donations will be -1 in the case of the  match and zero in the case of the rebate.

made by taxpayers at the basic rate of tax, currently 20  per cent ,5  which means that for  every £1 donated to charity, the charity can reclaim 25 pence.6  This can be thought of as  a match on donations made by taxpayers. In addition, higher-rate taxpayers can reclaim  a rebate equal to the difference between the higher rate of tax at 40 per cent and the  basic rate of tax  at 20 per cent on the “gross” equivalent donation, i.e. the amount before  basic rate tax was deducted. This means that for every £1 donated out of net income, a  higher-rate taxpayer can get an additional rebate of 25 pence.  
This two-part system is slightly more complicated than the US system of deductions but  is designed for a tax system where the majority of taxpayers do not file tax returns. Note  that in order for higher-rate taxpayers to receive the additional higher rate rebate, they  need to  make a cl aim through a self-assessment tax return (completed by approximately  a third of all UK taxpayers) or ask for a change in their tax code via a simpler tax review  form. Either way, there is an additional administrative cost for donors on the rebate  element compared to the match element.

When it was originally established, tax relief was only given for donations exceeding a minimum  threshold. This threshold was initially set at £600, reduced to £400 from May 1992 and to £250 from  March 1993 and abolished altogether in 2000.

 Note that individuals must have paid the amount of tax that the charity is going to reclaim, i.e. the relief  is a non-refundable tax credit.  
6 
 I n addition, charities can reclaim an additional 3 pence of transitional relief for every £1 given on  donations made before April 6, 2011 if a claim is made within two years of the end of the tax year in  which the donation is made. This is compensation for an earlier cut in  the basic rate of income tax.

Gift Aid is not the only scheme offering tax incentives for UK donors. There is also a  payroll-giving scheme that  allows donors to give to charity out of their gross earnings;  gifts of shares and property also attract tax relief and charitable bequests are exempt  from inheritance tax. However, as shown in Table 1, Gift Aid accounts for the majority  of tax-free donations –  more than £4 billion in 2008 -09 out of estimated total donations  of around £10 billion.7  Given the presence of both a match and a rebate element for  higher-rate taxpayers, Gift Aid provides the ideal opportunity to test the effect of match  and rebate  subsidies in a fiscal policy setting.  
The effect of offering tax relief through Gift Aid is to lower the “price” of giving to  charity. The price of giving £1 of funding to the charity is equal to (1 – r)/(1 + m)  where r  is the rebate rate and  m  is the  match rate .  In the UK, the effective match and  rebate rates are .25, but only higher-rate taxpayers are eligible for the rebate. Both basic- rate taxpayers and higher-rate taxpayers get relief at their marginal tax rates –  for  higher- rate taxpayers, the price of giving £1 of funding to a charity through Gift Aid is  therefore £.60, while for basic-rate taxpayers it is £.80. 
Assuming that consumers care about how much money charities receive,8  this reduction  in price brought about by the tax relief would be expected to result in an increase in total  funding going to charities (i.e. gross donations) but not necessarily an increase in  individuals’ net donations. Donors may take advantage of the fact that the government  has increased the value of the subsidy to charity to reduce the value of their cash  donation, an effect referred to as “crowd out” (see Andreoni, 2006,  for a discussion). 
9 
 If  the price elasticity of gross donations is less than unity in absolute value –  as  suggested  by recent estimates (e.g. Randolph, 1995, and Bajika and Heim, 2008) – then the effect

 The figure for total donations is an estimate. However, it suggests that a large proportion of all donations  
do not attract tax relief. This includes many donations made into collecting tins, as well as donations made  
by non-taxpayers.  
8 
 People may also wish to give to charity to signal their wealth and/or generosity. In this case gross  donations would be expected to respond more to changes in the rebate –  which change the price of the  signal –  than to changes in the match  –  which do not. Since this is inconsistent with the empirical findings,  here we do not consider this possible motivation for giving.  
9 
 If donors care only about how much the charity receives and not their own contribution (i.e. they are  pure altruists), then there is likely to be 100% crowd out; if donors also care about their own contribution  to the charity (i.e. if they are warm glow givers) then it will be less than this.

of tax relief will be to increase gross donations received by charity, but individuals’ net  donations will fall.  
However, the experimental findings of Eckel and Grossman (2003) suggest that there  may not be a single price elasticity, with gross donations responding differently to  changes in the match than to changes in the rebate. In light of those results, it is  important to account not only for how tax relief affects the price of giving, but also for  the actual form tax relief takes.   
3  
Sample and survey design 
Eckel and Grossman (2003) tested responses to match and rebate in a laboratory  experiment that involved 181 undergraduate students each given twelve allocation  problems varying in the initial endowment and match and rebate rates.  In the  experiment, match rates resulted in gross donations that were 1.2  to  2 times greater than  the equivalent-value rebate. The estimated match elasticity was -1.14 compared a rebate  elasticity of -.36.  Similar results were obtained from a  field experiment (Eckel and  Grossman, 2008). Based on approximately 7,000 responses  to a mail -out on behalf of  Minnesota Public Radio, offering match rates resulted in a higher level of gross  donations than equivalent-value rebates. The estimated elasticity of gross donations was  -1.05 in the case of the match rate and -.11 in the case of the rebate rate. 
The aim of this study is explicitly to test whether the match and rebate elasticities differ  with respect to tax-price changes. The overall design of our study was broadly consistent  with the field experiment described above.10  Survey respondents were randomly  allocated across “treatments” offering different levels of match and/or rebate subsidy in  order to test how donations respond. However, for practical reasons, the treatments  in  our study were purely hypothetical; we do not have any information on how donors  actually respond, instead individuals were  asked to sa y how they would respond to  hypothetical policy scenarios.  
There is an obvious potential concern that our results may be affected by hypothetical or  strategic bias (see Harrison and Rutström, 2009). We attempted to reduce this problem  from the start by informing the respondents that the survey was carried out on behalf of  the UK Treasury and emphasizing the need to answer questions carefully and honestly

to “ensure that any changes in the tax treatment of donations are designed to help both  donors and charities.”11  We also asked respondents to consider how the alternative tax  treatments would affect a specific donation that they were likely to make in the next six  months in order to make it more concrete.  
Finally, the survey itself contains a number of consistency checks. In particular we can  exploit the fact that each individual was asked to respond to two scenarios to check for  consistency. For example, we deliberately included the same treatment twice but in a  different order to test for so-called “embedding effects” (the phenomenon that the  responses depend on the way, and the order, in which questions are presented, see  Diamond and Hausman, 1994). As shown below, we find no evidence that such  embedding effects were important in practice.  
3.1  
The sample 
Invitations to take part in an on-line survey were e-mailed to 40,000 donors, split equally  between people with a Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) Charity Account and people  who had donated online through  Justgiving during the previous six months.   
CAF is a charity that, among a range of services for individuals and charities, provides a  charity account to donors to facilitate tax-efficient giving. Individuals pay into an  account and use the funds to make  donations to any registered charity  (currently more  than 80,000) through a variety of different means (direct debit, online, by phone or using  a CAF card or cheque book). For the survey, the relevant population consisted of 32,339  CAF account-holders  with  an e -mail address. E-mail invites were sent to a randomly  selected sample of 20,000 individuals within this population.   
Justgiving is an online giving portal that processes donations from individuals direct to  charity and individual sponsorships of charity fundraisers. Justgiving reclaims tax relief  at the basic rate of tax (assuming the donor is a taxpayer) and passes on the donations  and the tax relief to member charities.  Since it started in 1994, it has processed  donations for more than 8,000 charities.  For the survey, a random sample of 20,000  donors  were sent an e -mail invite out of a total population of 2.56 million who had  donated via Justgiving in the past six months.  
                                                  
11 
 This was motivated  by earlier findings that a so -called “cheap talk script” could reduce some of the  problems associated with hypothetical surveys –  see Cummings and Taylor (1999). 
7 

========9========

The response rates were 9.86% among the CAF sample and 9.19% among the Justgiving  sample. After some data cleaning, our analysis sample comprises 3,146 donors –  1,442  higher-rate taxpayers and 1,704 basic-rate taxpayers.12  Descriptive statistics on this  sample are summarised in Appendix 1. Due to both sampling and response bias, our  responses are unlikely to be fully representative of the UK population of Gift Aid  donors. In Appendix 1 we also present some evidence that we over-sample larger  donors;  respondents may also be better  informed about  in tax incentives than the average  Gift Aid donor.  Section 5 analyses responses among various sub -groups,  which gives an  indication of how this is likely to affect our results.  
3.2  
Survey design 
Respondents who were higher-rate taxpayers were randomly allocated to one of five  “treatments” each of which contained two hypothetical scenarios reflecting different  combinations of match and rebate. Basic rate taxpayers were randomly allocated to one  of two “treatments”, also each with two scenarios. All the scenarios are summarized in  Table 2. The design and description of the scenarios in the survey reflect the way Gift  Aid is currently portrayed to donors –  i.e. the charity receives  X  pence for every £1  given out of net-of-tax income and the individual can reclaim X  pence for every £1  given out of net-of-tax income.  
For each scenario, respondents were asked how the change in tax treatment would affect  their giving in relation to a specific “initial donation”, an amount they reported that they  were likely to give in the next six months.13  Figure A1  (Appendix 2) shows how the  hypothetical scenarios appeared in the on-line survey. Note that the specific terms,  “match” and “rebate” were not used in the survey because they are not used to describe  the scheme in practice. Respondents were first asked whether the change in tax  treatment would mean they would give the same, give more or give less. A follow-up  question then asked how much they would give if they reported that their donation  would change. 
                                                  
12 
 A small -scale pilot was used to test the questionnaire and observe response rates. In the pilot,  individuals were randomly offered a small financial inducement to take part but this had no significant  effect on response rates  and was not offered in the main survey . 
13 
 Only 10% of respondents said that they were unlikely to give in the next six mo nths. Where this was the  case, they were asked about a specific donation they had made within the past six months. Whether  individuals were asked about a future or past donation made no significant difference to the responses.

For each scenario, respondents were asked how the change in tax treatment would affect  their giving in relation to a specific “initial donation”, an amount they reported that they  were likely to give in the next six months.14  Figure A1 (Appendix 2) shows how the  hypothetical scenarios appeared in the on-line survey. Note that the specific terms,  “match” and “rebate” were not used in the survey because they are not used to describe  the scheme in practice. Respondents were first  asked whether the change in tax  treatment would mean they would give the same, give more or give less. A follow-up  question then asked how much they would give if they reported that their donation  
would change. 
For higher-rate taxpayers, two treatments – set A and set B in panel (a) –  tested  responses to changes in either  the match  or  the rebate (but not both). Note that the  changes in match and rebate were  symmetrical in terms of pence change for each £1

 Only 10% of respondents s aid that they were unlikely to give in the next six months. Where this was the  case, they were asked about a specific donation they had made within the past six months.

donated but, as shown in column (III), not price changes.15  This is in contrast to Eckel  and Grossman (2003, 2008) who defined match and rebate pairs that were equivalent in  value but had different rates –  for example, a 25% match and a 20% rebate. However,  experimental evidence shows that individuals respond differently to alternatives that  produce exactly the same outcome but that are presented to them through different  “frames of reference” (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). In this case, there is a potential  concern that donors may respond more to what they perceive is a “larger” match.  
In our survey, the changes in the match and rebate are expressed in terms of equal pence  changes but are not equivalent in terms of price. For example, in Set A, individuals are  faced with two scenarios: 
1) A match of 30 pence and a rebate of 25 pence (price of giving = .577); 
2) A match of 25 pence and a rebate of 30 pence (price of giving = .560). 
If the match and rebate elasticities are the same, there should be a larger percentage  change in gross donations under (2) because the price change is greater. If the donor  perceives the changes under (1) and (2) to be equivalent, gross donations should respond  in the same way under both. If we find that gross donations respond less to (2), this is a  strong indication that donations are less responsive to changes in the rebate than to  changes in the match.  
The other treatments for higher-rate taxpayers –  s ets C, D and E in panel (b) –  were  designed to explore responses to specific, possible policy options. They involved  scenarios that eliminated the rebate altogether and made the match subsidy more  generous. In set E, scenario 1 the match is 66 pence, changing the form of the tax  subsidy but not the price. The other scenarios in sets C, D and E, while increasing the  generosity of the match subsidy, involve increases in the price of giving compared to the  current system. The same scenarios were included twice  (C1 & E2 and C2 & D1) to test  for embedding effects. 
The current system only offers basic rate taxpayers a match and the scenarios, shown in  panel (c), tested changes in the match rate. Basic rate taxpayers were randomly assigned  to two treatments that  of fered the same scenarios, but in a different order.  
                                                  
15 
 The choice to make the changes symmetrical in terms of pence was to make it easier for respondents to  understand the proposed changes since they reflected the way Gift Aid is typically presented.

Table 2  also summarizes the number of people faced with each scenario and the average  amount donated by these individuals through Gift Aid over the previous 12 months.  While there is some variation in donations across scenarios, none of the differences is  statistically significant, indicating that the random allocation was effective.

Estimating responses to match and rebate  
We estimate the following random effects model16  separately for basic rate and higher - rate taxpayers to obtain the percentage change in donations associated with each of the  scenarios: 
ln gis  =  αi  +  βs  +  uis, 
(1) 
where gis  is the gross  donation of individual  i  under scenario  s –  defined as the nominal  donation the individual makes out of net-of-tax income grossed-up by the value of the  match if present (i.e. the total donation received by the charity);17 αi  is a fixed individual  specific term that captures the effects of observed and unobserved characteristics on  donations; βscaptures the response to each of the counterfactual scenarios (with β0  = 0); uis is a zero-mean, random error term associated with each level of donation for each  individual  that can be thought of as capturing rounding or reporting error for each  scenario. 
In the first instance, we include indicators for all ten scenarios for higher-rate taxpayers  and four scenarios for basic-rate taxpayers to test for embedding effects. Tests for  significant differences across the scenarios, reported in Appendix A2, showed there  were significant differences in gross donations  across distinct scenario pairs and not  across same scenario pairs. This acts  a check on the reliability of our results,  and is  consistent with there being no embedding effects.  
Of course, some of the variation in gross donations comes from the match rate  itself.  However, looking at the results from running the same regressions on nominal donations  (Appendix A2), there were many instances of significant differences across distinct  
                                                  
16 
 This is efficient and unbias ed if the rebate and match terms are unrelated to individuals’ characteristics.  Since the rebate and match terms are randomly allocated to individuals this should be true by assumption.  Very similar results were obtained from a fixed effects model.  
17 
 We f ocus on gross donations since this represents the individual’s total “giving” resulting from her   
contribution. It also allows us to compare our estimates with those from previous studies.

scenario pairs. This is in contrast to the findings from recent field experiments run by  Karlan and List (2007) and Huck and Rasul (2009),  which found that nominal donations  were insensitive to changes in the match rate (although not to the presence of a match  rate).    
With no significant difference in gross donations across same-scenario pairs, we choose  to focus the rest of the analysis on the smaller set of distinct scenarios. Table 3  summarises the results for the scenarios that change either  the match  or  rebate, which  are comparable with previous studies. Among higher-rate taxpayers, the results show a  significantly larger change in gross donations for a change in the match than for the  same pence change in the rebate.  
Table 3 also shows the implied elasticity of gross donations for each scenario (column  (3)) –  based on the e stimated percentage change in donations and the associated  percentage price change.18 The difference in elasticities between the match and rebate  changes is even greater than the difference in percentage changes in gross donations  because the change in the rebate is associated with a smaller percentage change in price.  Looking at column (3), panel (a), the match elasticity for higher-rate taxpayers is -1.417 for an increase in the match and -0.847  for a decrease in the match. For changes in the  rebate, the estimates are -0.498  and 0. 093  respectively.  For basic -rate taxpayers, the  implied match elasticities are -1.290  and  -1.258. 
In line with the earlier experimental studies, we therefore find that the match elasticity is  greater than the rebate elasticity.  In the previous studies,  the estimated match e lasticities  were in the range -1.14 to -1.05 and the rebate elasticities were in the range -.36 to -.11.  Of course, our  estimates may not be directly comparable because of differences in  sample composition across the studies.19  As we show in the next section, there is some  variation in elasticities across the population, according to characteristics such size of  donation.   
                                                  
18 
 We use a base price of 0.6 although, as we show later, many highe r-rate taxpayers do not reclaim the  
rebate and so face and effective price of 0.8. 
19 
 There is no information on the sample composition in Eckel and Grossman’s (2008) field experiment  
which would allow us to make a direct comparison. One further possible so urce of difference is that our  
results correspond only to adjustment on the intensive margin since we sample people who give through  
Gift Aid.

Heterogeneity of responses 
In this section we explore the responsiveness of donations to changes in the match and  rebate among a number of sub-groups. The aim is both to illustrate differences across  groups and to explore possible explanations for the observed difference in match and  rebate elasticity.  
Table 4 reports estimates of elasticities for different sub-groups. We focus on higher-rate  taxpayers and on responses to changes in either  the match  or  the rebate (i.e. the  set of  four scenarios in panel (a) in Table 2). Because of the smaller number of observations in  each group we pool across the four scenarios and run regressions of the form:20 
ln gis  =  αi  +  βr  ln (1  − rs) − βm  ln (1 + ms) + uis, 
(2) 
where βm  and  βr  capture the elasticity of gross donations with respect to the match and  rebate, respectively.  
                                                  
20 
 This assumes that gross donations depend on the price in the following way  gi  =  θi qβ 
r 
 ,  where  q  = (1  − r) / (1 + m)βm/β 
r, and β 
m/βr 
 is the relative weight given to the match compared to the rebate in  the price of giving.

5.1 
Reclaimers and non-reclaimers 
One possible explanation for why donations are more responsive to the match than to the  rebate may be because of the additional cost for the donor associated with reclaiming the  rebate, involving filling in a tax form. In practice, many higher-rate taxpayers do not get  the rebate and their donations are therefore only likely to respond to changes in the  match rate and not to changes in the rebate (although changes in the rebate may affect  the probability of reclaiming). We explore this by comparing responses among  reclaimers and non-reclaimers.21       
In our sample, 44% of higher-rate taxpayers were non-reclaimers. As might be expected  if the decision to reclaim were based on costs and benefits,22  the probability of  reclaiming is closely linked to the amount donated –  from fewer than 20 %  of those who  give a few pounds a year through Gift Aid to around 75%  of those who give more than  £2,000 a year (Figure 123).  
However, the presence of many non-reclaimers cannot fully account for the higher  match elasticity. As shown in Table 4 the estimated rebate elasticity among reclaimers is       
higher than among non-reclaimers, as would be expected (-.415 compared to .032).24 
However, among reclaimers, the estimated match elasticity is -1.277 and is significantly  higher than the rebate elasticity. 
                                                  
21 
 We did not directly ask whether changes in the rebate affected the decision to reclaim; we therefore split  the sample by whether people currently reclaim or not.  
22 
 More than half of non -reclaimers said they were not aware they could. But nearly one third of non- reclaimers cited the time and effort it would take, while a further 19% said that it was too complicated.  One-quarter said that they did not reclaim because they would only get a small amount of money back.  (Respondents could tick more than one answer.) 
23 
 Those who give more than £10,000 are not shown in this Figure; 97% of this group said that they  reclaimed.  
24 
 Of the various price elasticities estimated in this paper, the rebate elasticity for reclaimers is the most  
directly comparable to the estimated price elasticities from US studies which consider responses to  
changes in the rebate for itemizers, although we consider only the intensive margin. The estimate of -.415  
is consistent with the recent studies that suggest that the elasticity is less than one in absolute value.

5.2 
Level of understanding 
Another  factor that is likely to affect how people respond to the hypothetical scenario is  whether or not they understand the implications of the proposed change in tax treatment  for the price of giving. The effect of the proposed tax change on price is not explained in  the description of the scenario (see Figure A2) –  deliberately so since donors should  ideally respond to the scenario as they would to a change in the tax treatment, based on  their perception of how the tax change might affect the price of giving and their current  level of understanding.  
However, it is possible that at least some people do not fully understand the effect of the  proposed tax changes on the price of giving; they might also find it easier to understand  the implications of one of the two types of relief (match or rebate). In practice, therefore,  the response might vary according to whether people understand the implications of the  proposed tax change or not.  
To explore this, we analyse the responses separately for donors according to their likely  level of understanding of tax incentives. This is assessed on the basis of their response to  a question about how much the match is worth to charities. Respondents are told that the  charity can reclaim basic-rate tax and asked to say how much the charity gets for each  £1 donated out of net-of-tax income  (choosing one out of a set of possible responses) . If  they respond correctly, we define them as having a good level of understanding. If they  do not choose the correct answer, we define them as having a poor level of  
understanding. We find some difference between those with “good” and “poor”  understanding” –  those with a good understanding are more responsive to changes in  both match and rebate. Nevertheless, we find that the match elasticity is significantly  higher than the rebate elasticity for both groups.  
5.3  
Size of donations 
Table 4 also shows elasticity estimates by size of total donations, focusing on higher-rate  reclaimers. There is some evidence that donations from larger donors are more sensitive  to changes in the rebate than donations from smaller donors. Given that we over-sample  large donors, our results are therefore likely to be an under-estimate of the difference in  match and rebate elasticity among the population. Even in the top decile, however,  which includes donors who give £40,000 a year or more, the match elasticity is  significantly greater than the rebate elasticity.   
16 

========18========

5.4  
Adjusters/non-adjusters 
A unique feature of our survey approach, compared to existing field experiments, is that  it has a pseudo-panel element allowing us to see exactly how individuals respond to the  proposed tax changes. In practice, we find that a large number of people do not  respond  to the proposed tax change by adjusting their nominal donations (i.e. out of net-of-tax  income). The high levels of non-adjustment –  the majority of donors for each scenario  – are shown in Table 5,  which summarises the proportio n who adjust their donations,  separating higher-rate reclaimers and non-reclaimers.  
The very high level of non-adjustment is a striking finding from our survey. A potential  concern is that it may be an artefact of the hypothetical nature of the survey; there is no  benefit to respondents if they respond truthfully and calculating the optimal level of  donation associated with the new tax price may have a small computational cost. It may  simply be easier for donors to say that they would not adjust their nominal donations.  However, counter to this, Table 5 shows that the proportion adjusting varies 
         Table 5: Estimated elasticities for sub-groups

significantly across the scenarios – among higher-rate reclaimers, the proportion  adjusting to changes in the rebate is typically greater than the proportion adjusting to  changes in the match while among higher-rate reclaimers typically more people adjust to  a larger change  in the match rate . In many cases, these differences across scenarios arise  because the same individual reports that they will adjust in the case of one of the  scenarios and not the other.  Also, as already noted,  our finding on the match and rebate  elasticities is  in line with those from prev ious experimental studies, again suggesting  that the responses are plausible.  
Non-adjustment can potentially explain the difference between the observed match and  rebate elasticities because of the way in which the match and rebate differentially impact  on gross donations among non-adjusters –  the elasticities of gross donations with respect  to match and rebate among non-adjusters are -1 and zero respectively.  Assuming that  there is a single underlying elasticity, ε, with respect to changes in the match or rebate,  but that, for whatever reason,  only a proportion of donors  πm ( πr ) adjust to the match  (rebate) then the observed match ( ) and rebate ( ) elasticities are given by: 
, 
(3) 
(4) 
The observed match elasticity will be greater than the observed rebate elasticity if 
(5) 
If the probabilities of adjusting to the match and rebate are the same (and less than one),  the observed match elasticity will always be greater than the observed rebate elasticity.  In practice, we find that more people adjust to a change in the  rebate than to a  change in  the match (see Table 5). However, based on the observed proportions adjusting (and  focusing on responses to an increase in match/rebate), the observed match elasticity for  higher-rate reclaimers would still be greater than the observed rebate elasticity  so long  as the elasticity among adjusters is less than 3.70. 
Table 4 shows estimates of match and rebate elasticities separately for adjusters (i.e.  donors who adjust to at least one of the two scenarios). Within this group, gross donations are much more responsive to changes in the rebate compared to the rest of the  sample. While the match elasticity is still higher, the difference is no longer statistically  significant. This  finding indicates that the underlying elasticities may  be much more  
18 

========20========

similar, and that much of the explanation for the large observed difference between  match and rebate elasticities both here and in the earlier experimental studies lies in the  fact that many donors do not adjust their nominal donations in response to a tax change,  and the differential implications of changes in the match and rebate for gross donations  among non-adjusters. 
What then explains why so many donors do not adjust their nominal donations in line  with tax changes? Table 6 gives some insights, summarising donors’ responses when  they were asked why they were not going to change their donations. The most  commonly given reason is that donors decide on their level of nominal donations before  taking account of the tax relief. Within the literature on why people give to charity, there  are a number of possible explanations for why individuals may care about their level of  nominal donations (rather than the amount of money going to the charity), including a  desire to signal either their wealth or generosity.25  However, in these cases, the level of  donations would be expected to respond more to a change in the rebate, which would  change the price of the signal, than to a change in the match, which is not consistent with the empirical findings.26  In stead, in line with other studies on consumer behaviour

 This was also supported by other choice experiment questions in the survey that revealed that more  people would prefer tax relief in the form of a match to a rebate.   
19 

========21========

in response to taxes (Chetty et al., 2009, Finkelstein, 2009), we interpret these responses  as an indication that tax incentives are not “salient” for individuals’ decisions about how  much to give. The other responses indicate that there may be costs associated with  processing the change in instrument and adjusting the level of donation.27

Implications for policy design 
The role of private provision alongside public provision of collective goods has been the  source of much debate in the economics literature and in the policy debate, and  continues to be so.28  Even abstracting from this broader question, there is still the  narrower question  of why government would want to support private charities by  offering tax incentives to private donors rather by direct government grants to charities. 
How responsive donations are to changes in the price of giving is crucial in this respect.  A value of the price elasticity of giving equal to unity in absolute value implies that net  donations are insensitive to tax incentives, and that gross funding for charities increases  simply by the amount of the tax relief –  as it would if government support was deliv ered  through a direct grant. Thus, only if the elasticity is greater than unity in absolute value,  there is a prima facie argument for tax incentives. Nevertheless, a well-known argument  due to Roberts (1987) shows  that  even if net donations do not increas e when tax relief is  provided, delivering  government support via tax relief can still dominate direct  government grants to charities if the latter would have the effect of crowding out private  donations –  an effect for which there is convincing evidence (A ndreoni and Payne,  2001). 
Taking the objective of promoting private provision and the choice of doing so through  incentives as given, the observed difference between the match and rebate elasticities – with the former being greater than the latter –  sugges ts that it would be more efficient to  offer tax subsidies in the form of a match rather than a rebate, in terms of securing more  money for charities.  
                                                  
27 
 In a companion paper we show that these findings can be rationalised by a model of rational inattention. 28 
Examples are Feldstein and Clotfelter (1977), Warr (1982), Scharf (2000). 
20 

========22========

To explore this conjecture further, our hypothetical scenarios included a number of  options that removed the rebate altogether and instead channelled all tax relief to  charities as a higher match rate  (Table 2 , panel (c)). Table 6 shows the estimated average  change in gross donations –  and implied elasticitie s –  associated with each of these  options, focusing on higher-rate taxpayers. We run separate regressions for reclaimers  
and non-reclaimers.   
The average effect on gross donations is positive in all cases, although insignificant in  the case of offering a 30 pence match to reclaimers. In Scenario E1, the price of giving  is unchanged compared to the current system; the other scenarios involve a reduction in  the price of giving and the implied price elasticities shown in column 3 therefore have  the “wrong” sign  when compared to the current price of £0.60 that incorporates the  effect of both match and rebate element. In fact, for non-reclaimers, the changes make  the system of tax relief more generous; the implied elasticities when the  initial price is  taken to be £0.80 (i.e. including just the match) are shown in column 4.

These regression results give an indication of the average change in gross donations for  reclaimers and non-reclaimers. The overall effect on gross donations, however, needs to  take into account the relative proportions of these two groups in the population of Gift  Aid donors; and also the fact that bigger donors are typically more responsive than  smaller. We therefore estimate the likely overall effect on gross donations, as the  following: 
(6) 
where w  is a weight given to each  high-rate taxpayer group (N, non-reclaimers, and R,  reclaimers) to re-weight the sample proportions to those in the population29; G0  is initial gross donations. We do the same for the likely effect on the cost of tax relief to the government.30 
The results are shown in Figure 2. We show both the estimated percentage change in  gross donations and the estimated percentage change in the cost of tax relief for each of  the four distinct match rates in the scenarios – £0.30, £0.37, £0.50 and £0.66 –  together  with smoothed, linear predictions. The central estimates, shown by the bold lines,  assume that 35% of higher-rate taxpayers reclaim; we also carry out sensitivity analysis,  varying the proportion of higher-rate taxpayers who reclaim in the population by ten  percentage points above and below the central assumption  (shown by the paler lines) .  
The aims is to show the possibility of increasing gross donations, without increasing the  cost of tax relief  compared to the current system . The results suggest that this would be  possible by withdrawing the rebate and replacing  it with a match in the range £ 0.42 to  £0.47, depending on the proportion of higher-rate reclaimers. Alternatively, there is a  possible policy change that maintains  the current level of gross donations but with a  cost  saving (a match rate of £0.35). 
Of course, in practice, if the reform were systematic and permanent, then the long-run  elasticities may differ from those suggested by our survey responses. Also, the 
                                                  
29 
 Government statistics on the value of tax relief claimed suggest that 35 % higher-rate taxpayers reclaim  and we adjust the sample proportion in line with this. See Appendix A1 for further information.  
30 
 We do not consider any implementation and administration costs associated with the different options,  which may be considerable.

projections do not take into account potential differences in welfare effects arising from  donors’ inconsistent responses across the two instruments. As Chetty et al.  (2009) point  out, changes in tax instruments that induce no adjustments can also generate welfare  costs due to imperfect optimization on the part of economic  agents  –  i.e. the welfare  costs of the associated mistakes made.  
In the case of private contributions to collective goods, under the presumption that  overall volume of collective provision is below-optimal,31  subsidies to private giving  that are fully salient to individuals’ choices would not generate allocative distortions but  rather they would be a second-best instrument for offsetting pre-existing allocative  distortions. Even in the case where donors fail to respond to subsidy changes, we cannot  conclude that lack of full optimization on the part of individuals must translate into  lower individual welfare –  in a non -cooperative contribution game, less-than-full  optimization on the part of individuals can raise their ex-ante welfare if it supports a  collectively more efficient outcome. Thus (abstracting from distributional effects), there  is a presumption in this case that any policy change that raises the subsidy-inclusive  volume of donations would be efficiency improving.

associated with match-only options 
       
Note to figure: The central, bold  line indicates the percentage changes  in gross donations and the cost of  tax relief compared to the current system based on  an assumption that  35% of higher-rate taxpayers  reclaim the rebate. The paler lines  show  the same, assuming that 25% and 45% reclaim.

 Offering subsidies to giving can only be rationalized if collective provision is believed to be below its  
socially optimal level.

Sampling 
 
Our sample would ideally be representative of the population of Gift Aid donors but this is  unlikely because of both sampling and response bias. In practice, there is no population  information on Gift Aid donors to allow us to investigate the extent of bias. The best benchmark  is the Individual Giving Survey (IGS), a population-based survey that collects information on  giving, including the use of Gift Aid. However, as shown in the figure below, the IGS is also  likely to suffer from bias particularly in not  capturing higher -value donors –  the largest donation  was £46,000 in the last year in the IGS, compared to more than 100 donors who gave more than  £100,000 in the CAF/Justgiving sample.  
Figure A1: Distribution of total donations over the last 12 months 
To analyse the effect of possible policy options, we re -weight the taxpayer groups in the  CAF/Justgiving sample to reflect estimated population shares , assuming that 80 per cent of Gift  Aid donors are basic rate taxpayers and assuming that 35 per cent  of higher-rate taxpayers  reclaim  (based on HMRC statistics). This re -weighting reduces the mean annual donation in the  sample from £2,272 to £1,345. This is still larger than the mean annual donation in the IGS  sample as shown in the table below. But at least some of this is explained by the larger tail in the  CAF/Justgiving sample. Excluding donations of £50,000 or more (of which there are none in the  IGS sample), the mean annual donation in the CAF/Justgiving sample falls to £1,137.
