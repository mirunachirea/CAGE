Abstract 
Previous theories of globalization have examined factor mobility’s effect on the political conﬂict 
between social classes. But factor mobility also increases competition between state rulers in provid- 
ing services for citizens. I ask how this interstate competition affects the process of political change. 
In a simple model, interstate competition substitutes for democracy, by forcing rulers to invest in pub- 
lic goods so as to avoid capital and labor leaving the country. As a result, citizens are less willing to 
struggle for democracy, and rulers are less willing to oppose it, when interstate competition is strong. 
Therefore, there is less conﬂict over the level of democracy. The theory is tested on a post-war panel 
of countries, using neighboring countries’ ﬁnancial openness as a proxy for factor mobility. As the 
theory predicts, states experience fewer changes in their level of democracy when their neighbors are 
ﬁnancially open.

"Supposing I’m now 21, 22, what would I do? I would not be absorbed in wanting to change 
life in Singapore....Why should I go and undertake this job and spend my whole life pushing 
this for a lot of people for whom nothing is good enough? I will have a fall-back position, 
which many are doing – have a house in Perth or Vancouver or Sydney, or an apartment in

1 Introduction 
In recent history, it has become easier for capital and labor to move between countries. How does this 
affect the political process within individual countries? Political scientists have answered this question 
with models of conﬂict between social classes (Rogowski, 1989; Boix, 2003; Acemoglu and Robinson, 
2006). Doing so, they have assumed that the state faithfully serves the interest of the class in power. This 
paper takes a different approach, and examines the vertical conﬂict between rulers and ruled. Rulers in 
every country are imperfect agents of their principals, the citizens. They have their own interests; unless 
they are constrained, they may pursue them at the expense of the governed. As a result, factor mobility 
not only affects economic competition between producers in different countries, it also increases compe- 
tition between rulers themselves. Understanding how globalization affects politics means understanding 
how competition between governments affects politics. One fundamental effect is the reduction of slack 
within the political system itself: when labor and capital can exit easily from their rule, rulers can extract 
less rent from the political process. Thus, mobility can be a substitute for another way to limit rulers’ 
extraction – the democratic process, which allows the orderly replacement of bad governments. Since 
factor mobility is a substitute for democracy, citizens have less demand for democracy when factors are 
mobile. Similarly, rulers have less incentive to resist democratic reforms, because factor mobility limits 
the potential gains from doing so. The overall effect of globalization is to reduce conﬂict over the level 
of democracy. As a result, political systems are simply less prone to change, either towards or away from 
democracy. 
Putting political agency back into the picture is especially likely to yield better theory in the many 
developing countries where unconstrained, predatory rulers are a central feature of politics. It also has 
2 

========3========

practical implications. For instance, the recently-launched Charter Cities Foundation encourages rich 
and poor countries, working in partnership, to set up charter cities – new statelets with settled laws and 
sound management, to which citizens could migrate. This is explicitly meant as an alternative to the 
normal political process of “change from within” (Charter Cities Foundation 2009). Existing theory has 
little to say about how the implementation of these radical ideas would affect politics in surrounding 
states. This paper attempts to ﬁll that gap. 
I develop my approach in a simple formal model on the lines of Olson (1993). Self-interested rulers are 
bandits. Democracy provides a beneﬁt: bandits can be replaced by their (potentially superior) rivals. It 
also has a cost: bandits who expect to be replaced have a shorter time horizon and are less likely to make 
investments which increase growth and the future tax base.1 In general, the optimal level of democracy 
balances these two forces. Interstate competition affects this trade-off. By imposing a minimum welfare 
level which a ruler must satisfy in order to prevent labor and assets moving to more attractive regimes, it 
makes self-interested rulers less harmful, and so lessens the beneﬁt of democracy. As a result, interstate 
competition and democracy are substitutes for citizens; more of one means citizens demand less of the 
other.2 On the other hand, external competition constrains rulers and limits their proﬁts, making it less 
beneﬁcial to stay in ofﬁce. Therefore, an increase in external competition lowers rulers’ willingness to 
ﬁght against democratization. Putting these incentives together, there is more (less) underlying conﬂict 
over the level of democracy as external competition falls (rises). In a very simple model of political 
change, more underlying conﬂict means more shifts, both up and down, in the level of democracy. Thus, 
the theory predicts that in countries where factors can easily exit, both kinds of shift should be rarer. 
I test this prediction on a panel of countries in the postwar period. To mitigate the problem of endo- 
geneity, I examine the effect of neighboring countries’ ﬁnancial openness on the number of changes in 
a country’s level of democracy. When their neighbors are more open, countries indeed experience fewer 
changes in the level of democracy: there is strong evidence that democratic breakdown becomes less 
likely, and some evidence that democratization becomes less likely. 
1Bates (2008) makes this argument in depth for the case of modern Africa. 
2However, the free market in jurisdictions is not a panacea. As I show later (Section 3.6), very high levels of interstate competition can harm citizen welfare by encouraging rulers to plunder rather than invest.

2 Literature Review3 
Scholars examining the effect of factor mobility have focused on its distributional consequences, and 
have seen politics as a process of conﬂict, negotiation and coalition between social groups. For instance, 
Rogowski (1989) uses the Stolper-Samuelson theorem to predict coalitions between capital, land and la- 
bor: in any country, relatively scarce factors will ally to oppose free trade, and relatively abundant factors 
to support it. The link between factor mobility and democratization has been explained with a similar 
logic. Democratization occurs when the rich decide to share power with the poor, because the costs of 
repression are too high (Boix, 2003), and/or because democratization allows the rich to make credible 
long-term commitments to redistribution (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006). The cost of democratization, 
for the rich, is that the newly-empowered majority will introduce high levels of redistributive taxation. 
Capital mobility reduces the threat of this taxation, since overtaxed assets can be moved out of the coun- 
try. As a result, capital mobility makes democratization less costly to the rich, and it should therefore 
lead both to more democratizations and to fewer breakdowns of democracy. 
The political model underlying these theories is that political outcomes reﬂect the balance of power 
between different social groups. However, in many countries, especially developing countries, politics is 
not driven by exogenously given social classes. Instead, social interests are vulnerable to state predation. 
Because the rule of law is not entrenched, rulers cannot commit not to expropriate proﬁts. Indeed, this 
political economy has been put forward to explain the “Leontief paradox” that factors such as skilled 
labor and capital do not ﬂow from rich to poor countries (where they are relatively scarcer), but from 
poor to rich (Eaton and Gersovitz, 1984; Olson, 1996). In these settings, the distributional impacts 
of international openness may be secondary to the fact that openness limits rulers’ expropriation. The 
implications for democratization will be correspondingly different. 
Since Tiebout (1956),4 an economic literature on local government has examined whether exit alone 
can induce efﬁciency in production of public goods.5 
The overall conclusion is negative (Westhoff, 
3Existing empirical work on the link between factor mobility and democratization is discussed in Section 4. 
4And earlier: “The division of Europe into a number of independent states ... is productive of the most beneﬁcial con- sequences to the liberty of mankind.... The object of [a modern tyrant’s] displeasure, escaping from the narrow limits of his dominions, would easily obtain, in a happier climate, a secure refuge, a new fortune adequate to his merit, the freedom of complaint, and perhaps the means of revenge.” (Gibbon, 1776) 
5Here “local” means governments with a possibility of exit. For a thorough review see Scotchmer (2002).

1977; Epple and Zelenitz, 1981; Bewley, 1981). However, perhaps because the literature has centred 
on subnational governments within democratic countries, there has been little examination of how inter- 
governmental competition affects political forms.6 This paper shows how interstate competition changes 
citizens’ and rulers’ demand for democracy, and draws predictions about the twin processes of democra- 
tization and democratic breakdown. 
In general, horizontal and vertical conﬂict surely both play a role in shaping political struggle, so the 
perspective advanced here ought to to complement, not replace existing explanations. The conclusion 
suggests how further research might integrate class- and agency-based models of political change. In this 
paper, I focus on the logic of political agency only. 
3 A Model of Interstate Competition 
To show how interstate competition affects the demand for democracy, this section develops a simple 
one-factor, one-country model. There are two actors, a representative citizen and a ruler. (All conﬂicts of 
interest between citizens are abstracted away in favor of the vertical conﬂict between citizens and rulers.) 
In the ﬁrst stage, actors make choices affecting the level of democracy. Then, policy is made within the 
resulting political system. 
3.1 The ﬁrst stage 
Denote the level of democracy by d 2 [0;1]. Controversy abounds as to whether democracy is a contin- 
uous or dichotomous variable. Here, d measures the probability that citizens can remove an unattractive 
incumbent. Thus, d can represent the probability of a fair election in a democracy, or the probability of 
a chance to revolt in a dictatorship. (One underlying model in a dictatorship could be that leaders are 
removed when political activists solve a coordination problem, which they do with probability d, and 
when the populace support the activists.) d therefore represents something slightly broader than democ- 
racy, encompassing both natural and institutionalized ways to replace a ruler; all that is required is that 
6A notable exception is Hirschman (1970), who argues that the availability of exit may weaken “the art of voice”. Here, I simply argue that exit lowers the demand for voice. 
5 

========6========

sometimes, citizens and rulers will get the chance to change the level of d. 
Thus, the initial level of democracy is d = d. With probability p, the ruler may choose to decrease d 
by up to some small value D, by paying a cost c drawn from a distribution with full support on R+. 
Otherwise (i.e. with probability 1 
 p), the citizens may increase d by up to D, by paying a cost c drawn 
from a (different) distribution with support on R+.7 After this stage the level of d is ﬁxed and the game 
proceeds. 
3.2 The policy game 
The government output is the level of public investment. The ruler makes a costly investment L > 0. 
There is then an election with probability d. After the election, the (perhaps new) ruler extracts a tax or 
rent of t  0. For simplicity, and to focus on the effect of asset mobility, I set no upper limit on t, and 
assume no deadweight losses. Citizen utility is 
 t+ f(L) where f is increasing and concave and satisﬁes 
the Inada conditions f(a) ! ¥ as a ! 0, f(a) ! 0 as a ! ¥. f(0) = 0. L could stand for different 
decisions. For instance, it might be a costly investment in nationbuilding or public infrastructure, perhaps 
ﬁnanced out of earlier taxes that could otherwise be consumed as rent. Or it might simply represent 
refraining from early rent extraction, which would harm economic growth (captured by f). 
Rulers, whether incumbents or newly elected, are Good with probability g and Bad otherwise. Good 
rulers receive utility 
 t + f(L) 
 L, i.e. they have the same utility as citizens, plus their cost of effort. 
Bad rulers receive utility t 
 L: they enjoy the rents from taxation. (If citizens send assets abroad, good 
rulers receive u 
 L and bad rulers receive 
 L. If bad rulers are replaced, they receive 
 L utility.) Ruler 
type is observed at election time, so that elections allow bad rulers to be replaced.8 
The terminology of “good” and “bad” ruler types ought not to be taken literally. Ruler motivations might 
indeed vary because of intrinsic character differences, but also for other reasons. For instance, “good” 
types may be effectively constrained by a party apparatus which internalizes the economic beneﬁts of 
7A more complex simultaneous game is imaginable. For instance, both citizen and rulers might choose a level of activity, and the level of democracy would be a stochastic outcome. The simple form chosen here represents the idea that sometimes, one side has an informational advantage over the other, and may leverage this to make a change unilaterally. 
8Another approach would be to have no types, and to have a shock to the ruler’s popularity so that rulers are not always reelected. This alternative would produce the same substantive results. 
6 

========7========

investment, while bad types are able to evade these constraints and rule in their personal interest. Or, 
good types may have time horizons beyond their expected stay in ofﬁce, and may therefore be concerned 
to expand the economy. The essential requirement is that elections have a role in selecting rulers, so that 
citizens’ future welfare may depend on the election result.9 
So far, nothing limits rent extraction t. The key independent variable which fulﬁls this role is the level 
of political competition from other states. Thus, having observed t, citizens can keep their assets in the 
country, or send them abroad; if they do they receive welfare of u. The interpretation is that assets can 
be moved to another country, with different levels of the public good and rent extraction, for some cost. 
u can be broken down as 
u = f(LF) 
 tF 
 C; 
(1) 
where LF and tF are policy parameters of the other country andC is the cost of moving assets.10 
To understand what u means in practice, consider three neighboring countries in South-East Asia. In- 
donesia is the world’s fourth-most populous country, with a diverse population, speaking either local 
languages or Indonesian. Malaysia is considerably smaller and has a larger Chinese minority. Singapore, 
which split from Malaysia in 1963, is a tiny city-state which thrives on international trade; Chinese are 
in the majority and English is an ofﬁcial language. It is fair to say that an average Indonesian worker 
would ﬁnd it harder to exit his or her country than an average Malaysian, who would in turn ﬁnd it harder 
than a Singaporean. Similarly, Singapore relies on footloose foreign direct investment; Malaysia does so 
to some degree, and Indonesia much less (UNCTAD 2009). Singapore’s capital, like its labor, is more 
mobile than that of Malaysia, which is more mobile than that of Indonesia. Thus, Singapore has the 
highest u, Malaysia has an intermediate level, and Indonesia has the lowest u. 
The analysis excludes rulers themselves changing u by imposing border controls, emigration restrictions 
and so forth. This undoubtedly happens, but the assumption here is that some factors affecting interstate 
competition – such as transport costs or global capital markets – are beyond the ruler’s inﬂuence, and 
that many societies and economic systems make total control over emigration hard to achieve, just as 
9Jones and Olken (2005) provide evidence that leaders’ identities matter to their countries’ economic performance. 
10I assume that the public good in a country beneﬁts the owners of assets employed in that country, i.e. one cannot move one’s asset abroad and enjoy the public good at home. 
7 

========8========

many advanced societies ﬁnd it hard to control immigration. In any case, allowing the ruler to change u 
would generate fairly unsurprising predictions: u would be raised until the cost of doing so outweighed 
the cost of providing public investment. 
3.3 Ruler behaviour 
The game is solved by backward induction. After the election, good rulers choose t = 0 and citizens 
migrate if u > f(L). Bad type rulers choose the maximum t that satisﬁes the migration constraints (if 
no t does this their choice is irrelevant and t = 0 anyway since they can extract no taxes): u = f(L) 
 t, 
hence t = f(L) 
 u. At the election, citizens reelect good rulers and only good rulers, since they extract 
less rent. 
Before the election, good types solve maxL f(L) 
 L, making an investment of L where f0(L) = 1. I 
assume f(L)  u; i.e. a good ruler can invest enough to prevent migration. Bad types solve 
max(1L 
 d)(f(L) 
 u)+ 
 L: 
(2) 
Here, (x)+ means maxf0;xg. If f(L) 
 u<0 then the ruler receives no tax after the election since citizens 
migrate. Otherwise, f(L) 
 u is the tax after the election. 
Intuitively, democracy seems likely to increase welfare, by removing bad type rulers. However, there 
is a counteracting force. Even bad types have an incentive to invest, since this efﬁcient choice allows 
them to extract more rent after the election than they lose immediately. In other words, they balance the 
attractions of rent now against the beneﬁts of future rents from investment now, if they remain in ofﬁce. 
These future beneﬁts decrease when d increases. This is the well-known story of the “stationary bandit” 
(Olson, 1993). It is particularly relevant in emerging democracies, where stable party systems have 
not yet evolved. Parties which can expect to regain ofﬁce after losing an election may have long-term 
incentives to invest.11 
11For evidence that short-termism reduces democratic performance, see Tavares and Wacziarg (2001). 
8 

========9========

The bad type ruler’s investment is as follows. Deﬁne Lˆ as the solution to 
f0(Lˆ) = 1=(1 
 d): 
(3) 
Lˆ is decreasing in d and is no more than the socially optimal investment L; if d = 0, Lˆ = L. The ruler 
either invests this much, or nothing. 
Claim 1. The bad type ruler invests Lˆ if Lˆ < (1 
 d)(f(Lˆ) 
 u). Otherwise he invests 0.12 
The bad ruler’s equilibrium investment is a function of the level of democracy, and of interstate com- 
petition. Write it as LB = LB(d;u). Observe that LB  L always, that LB is decreasing in d13 and that 
LB = L if d = 0: a completely secure dictator invests optimally in the public good, since he will be able 
to claw back all the beneﬁt by extracting more rent. Insecure dictators invest less than the optimum. 
3.4 Citizen welfare 
Given ruler behaviour, we can now compute citizen welfare and answer the fundamental question: how 
do changes in u affect the tradeoff between different levels of democracy? Citizen utility is 
UCIT = g f(L) + (1 
 g)[dgmaxff(LB(d;u));ug+ (1 
 dg)u]: 
(4) 
The ﬁrst term gives utility from a good type ruler who is always reelected. The second term gives utility 
from a bad type ruler. dg is the probability of the event that there is an election, and the bad ruler is 
replaced by a good one. If so, the good type extracts no rent and the citizens may achieve higher utility 
than u. Otherwise, the bad type always extracts rent until citizens are just indifferent between moving 
assets and staying where they are (or has invested so little that the citizens move assets anyway). The 
beneﬁt of the good type coming in varies depending on the investment decision taken by the bad type. 
If this was low, perhaps because the bad type expected to be thrown out by the citizens, then even the 
good ruler will be unable to achieve very high citizen welfare. On the other hand, if the bad type invested 
12Proofs are in the Appendix. 13As shown in the Appendix. 
9 

========10========

more, expecting to recoup his investment, then the good ruler will be able to build on this investment and 
achieve high welfare. The trade-off: bad types only invest much if they are unlikely to be replaced. 
Returning to our Asian examples, each has had notable rulers. Indonesia experienced Suharto, whose 
rule brought economic growth but who embezzled public funds on a massive scale. Malaysia has had 
a democracy with a single ruling party; Mahathir bin Mohamed was Prime Minister for twenty years. 
Singapore, of course, has been ruled by Lee Kuan Yew, who is quoted above. If we compare the un- 
constrained behaviour of the two dictators, and judge by the GDP growth ﬁgures, Lee’s performance 
overshadows that of Suharto. The model would explain this as follows: on coming to power, Lee in- 
herited a trading state with highly mobile capital and labor, leaving him little scope for rent extraction 
beyond paying his family large salaries. Suharto, by contrast, inherited a milch cow. Lee, more than 
Suharto, needed to develop his state’s economy in order to reap the rewards. 
The main predictions of this paper come from the case where bad type rulers have some incentive to 
make an investment. Section 3.6 discusses the other case, where external competition is so high that 
bad rulers prefer to make no investments. The following two Lemmas show that, in the central case, an 
increase in u makes democracy less appealing for the citizens. In economic terms, external competition 
and democracy are substitutes. Formally, the two parameters have decreasing differences for the citizens 
(see Ashworth and de Mesquita 2006). The reason is simple: an increase in u forces the bad ruler 
to extract less rent, so the beneﬁt from democracy of replacing the bad ruler with a good one is less. 
However, democracy still lowers the bad ruler’s investment by the same amount. Overall, the net beneﬁt 
of democracy decreases. It is easy to show this. Differentiating (4) by d gives the marginal beneﬁt of 
democracy: 
 
(1 
 g)g 
 f(Lˆ) 
  u+d 
df(Lˆ) 
dd 
: 
(5) 
Inside the square brackets, the ﬁrst term is the beneﬁt from throwing out bad rulers and replacing them 
by good ones. The second term is the loss caused because the bad type lowers his investment. A higher 
u lowers the ﬁrst term but not the second. 
Lemma 2. If the bad ruler invests positively in equilibrium, then the marginal beneﬁt of d for citizen 
utility is decreasing in u. 
10 

========11========

This Lemma is the hinge of the argument. It shows that external competition makes democracy less 
attractive for citizens. The bad ruler’s case is the opposite. (When the ruler is good, neither citizens nor 
rulers ever change d, since the ruler would always be reelected: this accords with the intuition that good 
rulers do not generate radical political opposition.) Since external competition shrinks the rent that can 
be extracted after the election, and democracy lowers one’s chances of getting that rent, more external 
competition makes democracy less bad. 
Lemma 3. If the bad ruler invests positively in equilibrium, then his utility decreases in d, but his 
marginal utility loss from an increase in d is decreasing in u. 
3.5 The political stage 
The two Lemmas above show that a higher level of external competition will make both sides’ stakes in 
the level of democracy lower. Citizens will gain less from achieving an increase in democracy, and rulers 
will lose less from granting it; rulers will gain less, and citizens will lose less, from lowering the level of 
democracy. 
Recall that in the political stage, with probability p, the ruler may change d by paying a cost c drawn 
from a distribution with full support. He will do so if c is less than the resulting increase in his welfare. 
Lemma 3 shows that, because the ruler gains less from a decrease in d when u is higher, the maximum 
cost the ruler will pay is also lower when u is higher. Similarly, with probability 1 
 p the citizens may 
change d. Lemma 2 shows that when u is high the beneﬁt to citizens of an increase in d is smaller, so 
citizens will take fewer opportunities to change d. Therefore, there are less changes to democracy when 
d is higher.14 
The next Proposition conﬁrms this. 
Proposition 4. If the bad ruler would invest positively for all d 2 [d 
 D;d +D], a small increase in 
external competition u results in fewer increases and fewer decreases in the level of democracy d, and a 
small decrease in external competition results in more increases and decreases to d. 
14The logic depends on the unilateral nature of the choice to change 
d. If both citizens and rulers made choices simultaneously in the political stage, the effect of u on equilibrium outcomes might be indeterminate. (More change might occur when both actors exert less effort.) However, if the probability of any change increases in the effort levels of both actors, then the result is likely to hold. 
11 

========12========

The Asian cases illustrate this point. Figure 1 shows yearly changes in Polity IV over the postwar period 
in the three countries. Singapore has been completely stable – there have been no internal revolutions 
or coups since independence. Malaysia experienced a drop in its score in 1969, after a race riot led to 
the introduction of repressive laws and a never-lifted state of emergency. Indonesia’s graph reﬂects its 
political turbulence: increasing repression under Sukarno, followed by the bloody anti-Communist purge 
of the 1960s and the rise of Suharto, and a democratic revolution in the wake of the Asian ﬁnancial crisis. 
The countries most exposed to interstate competition have seen the least internal turmoil. 
[Figure 1 about here] 
Proposition 4 makes no prediction about the relative size of the effect of external competition on increases 
and decreases in d; that will depend on the political opportunity structure. For example, if opportunities 
for the ruler to reduce d never arrive, but there are many opportunities for citizens to push for greater 
democracy, then external competition will have little effect on decreases in d, but a large effect on 
increases in d. 
3.6 Extractive rulers and state collapse 
Although it is not the focus of the empirics, the case when bad rulers make zero investment is also 
interesting. Here, external competition is so high that no investment by the bad ruler can reach it, and 
still be more proﬁtable in expectation than simply choosing zero investment. This is a situation of state 
collapse, followed by massive emigration. The past decade’s events in Zimbabwe are a good example. 
Mugabe’s government pillaged ﬁrmland and gave it to their supporters, while debasing the currency; as a 
result, an estimated 3.4 million people left Zimbabwe, out of a population of about 10 million (Meldrum, 
2007). 
I do not investigate democracy’s effect on citizen welfare in this case. The true beneﬁt of democracy 
in these situations is presumably that replacement rulers may begin to make their own investments over 
longer periods, and this is not modeled in the framework here. The effect of u on citizen utility is more 
12 

========13========

interesting, however. Rewrite Claim 1’s condition for zero investment as 
(1 
 d)[f(Lˆ) 
 u] 
 Lˆ  0: 
(6) 
When (6) holds, citizen utility conditional on a bad type incumbent is just u; since bad rulers always lead 
to asset mobility, it helps if asset mobility is better. However, as u increases past the point where (6) holds 
with equality, investment jumps downward from Lˆ to 0. Furthermore, at this point, Lˆ > 0.15 Therefore, 
using the relevant part of (4), conditional citizen utility also jumps downwards to dg f(Lˆ) + (1 
 dg)u. 
Thus, interstate competition is no panacea. While reasonable levels of competition may discipline rulers 
and force them to invest, too strong competition encourages a strategy of plunder. This suggests an 
interesting explanation for the problems of Zimbabwe, and perhaps of some Central American countries: 
their prosperous neighbors (a resurgent South Africa; the US) may damage them by destroying incentives 
for responsible government. 
4 Evidence 
Proposition 4 predicts more changes both towards and away from democracy when external competition 
is low.16 This gives the following hypotheses: 
Hypothesis 1a. Democratic reforms will be more likely when states are insulated from external compe- 
tition. 
Hypothesis 1b. Changes away from democracy will be more likely when states are insulated from exter- 
nal competition. 
4.1 Empirical Design 
Research to test these hypotheses faces three major challenges. First, the key dependent and independent 
variables are difﬁcult to measure. Democracy has been conceptualized and measured in different ways; 
15Shown in the Appendix. 
16I assume that the case of state collapse in Section 3.6 is exceptional. 
13 

========14========

on the other hand, there are no direct measurements of the level of external competition, i.e. of the return 
from moving assets to another state. Second, there are clear dangers of endogeneity. The opportunities 
for capital and labor to exit a country may be inﬂuenced by a state’s politics, which may in turn be 
inﬂuenced by the level of democracy. Lastly, since many factors inﬂuence political change, there may be 
omitted variable bias: different levels of external competition may correlate with unmeasured variables 
which also affect democracy. 
Existing empirical work relating globalization to democratization has used different strategies to address 
these problems. Boix (2003) uses industrial structure (share of agriculture in GDP) to proxy for as- 
set speciﬁcity (hence, asset mobility) in a long panel of countries. He ﬁnds that countries with greater 
speciﬁcity are more likely to experience a breakdown in democracy, but not less likely to experience 
a democratization.17 This is compatible with the argument advanced here. However, it is unclear that 
agriculture’s GDP share only affects the political process via asset speciﬁcity. Rudra (2005) estimates 
globalization’s effect on democracy conditional on welfare spending, while Li and Reuveny (2002) mea- 
sure various aspects of globalization including trade and FDI. These studies deal with endogeneity by 
lagging the independent variables, which may not be sufﬁcient. 
Eichengreen and Leblang (2006) examine the effect of capital controls (as well as trade) in a country 
on democratization. To avoid the problem of endogeneity to policy, they instrument these with those of 
other countries. Their dynamic results are broadly in line with my predictions, though weak (ibid., Table 
11). However, since capital controls affect capital mobility in both origin and destination countries, it is 
hard to imagine a process that leads from own-country capital controls to democratization without also 
separately leading from other countries’ capital controls to democratization (and thus violating the exclu- 
sion restriction). Similarly, their other instruments (country size, inﬂation, budget deﬁcits and currency 
crises) are a priori unlikely to satisfy the exclusion restriction, although they do test the instruments 
collectively for overidentiﬁcation. 
In short, existing results are broadly compatible with my hypotheses, but are not conclusive. A fresh 
look at the data therefore seems worthwhile. My strategy is as follows. Firstly, I use two measures of 
democracy: Polity IV, and the Przeworski et al. (2000) measure, as updated by Cheibub, Gandhi and 
17Models 3A and 3B, page 80.

Vreeland (2009). Polity IV is a rather broad measure of democracy, compared to my theoretical focus 
on the possibility of leadership replacement. However, most of its components ought to relate to this 
possibility, and in addition, because Polity is a continuous measure from -10 to 10, it is more sensitive 
to small changes in the level of democracy. The Przeworski measure is coarser, but less subjective. My 
dependent variable is a dummy taking the value 1 when either the Polity or the Przeworski democracy 
score changed in a given country-year. 
Any appropriate measure of u ought to come from one of the components of u in equation (1). One 
possible measure would be wages or returns on capital in neighboring countries, compared to own- 
country returns. However, there is likely to be considerable endogeneity, since instability may affect 
wages and returns to capital in a country. To avoid this problem, one can instead measure C, the cost of 
moving assets. 
For labor mobility, an ideal measure would be the strictness of immigration policy over time in different 
countries.18 However, no such measure exists. Until it does, exogenous measures of labor mobility will 
be hard to ﬁnd.19 Therefore, in this section I focus on capital mobility. For this, my independent variable 
is the Chinn-Ito measure of capital openness. This is a de jure measure, available from 1970 onwards and 
based on IMF data on legal controls on capital inﬂows and outﬂows. The variable of interest, i.e. the real 
cost of moving capital between countries, will be affected by the level of these controls in both origin and 
destination countries. However, controls in the origin country are clearly endogenous to policy, which 
may in turn be affected by political changes. Instead, I use the average score of a country’s neighbors 
(those within 1000 miles distance), weighted by each neighbor’s GDP. So, my key independent variable 
is: 
NbrOpennessi;t = 
jGDPj;tOpennessj;t 
jGDPj;t 
where the sum ranges over all countries within 1000 miles. The logic is that foreign investment levels, 
like trade, have been shown to be strongly affected by distance between countries (Blonigen, 2005): 
thus, changes in capital controls will have most effect in nearby countries which are likely destinations 
18An initial step in this direction is the information on country policies collected in Mayda (2009). 19Earlier versions of this paper used distance from major migration hosts as a proxy for ease of migration.

for assets seeking a safe haven. Also, using neighbors’ mobility lowers the danger of endogeneity. 
Although it cannot be absolutely guaranteed that capital controls are unaffected by constitutional change 
in neighboring countries, the assumption is defensible. 
To mitigate omitted variable bias, I include country ﬁxed effects. These are likely to account for many 
factors affecting a country’s political stability which change little over time, such as ethnic fractional- 
ization or the presence of mineral exports. The country ﬁxed effects mean that the independent variable 
becomes changes in the level of neighbors’ capital controls: since these changes are likely to have an 
impact only in the medium- to long-term, I use averages of neighbor capital controls over the past ﬁve 
years. As further controls, I include: Polity and its square or the Przeworski Democracy measure (lagged 
one year), logged country GDP, average Polity IV measure for neighboring countries over the previous 
ﬁve years (Nbr Polity), and logged average GDP for neighboring countries over the previous ﬁve years 
(Nbr GDP). To model time-dependence in changes to the dependent variable, I include natural cubic 
splines in time since last change to or from democracy, and also dummies for ﬁve-year periods. 
Lastly, OECD countries are excluded from the panel, since almost all are stable democracies, and would 
be unlikely to change under any circumstances. 
I run logit regressions. While ﬁxed effects remove bias due to unobserved, time-constant omitted vari- ables, they also reduce efﬁciency by ignoring the information contained in differences between countries. Indeed, country effects account for about 80% of the variation in Nbr Openness (R2: 0.7934). So, at ﬁrst I exclude country ﬁxed effects and controls, running a simple bivariate logit on Nbr Openness; then I include the controls, then controls plus ﬁxed effects (estimated using conditional logit). The following equations summarize the regressions:

4.2 Results 
For a ﬁrst look at the data, Figure 2 plots the density of Nbr Openness for country-years in the sample, 
splitting these by their initial Democracy score (on the Przeworski measure) and by whether they experi- 
enced a transition, i.e. a change in the Democracy score. For democracies, in particular, countries which 
experienced a transition clearly had less open neighbors. The pattern for dictatorships is similar but less 
striking. 
[Figure 2 about here] 
The ﬁrst set of regression results is shown in Table 2. For the Democracy dependent variable, the co- 
efﬁcient on Nbr Openness is consistently negative and signiﬁcant, as the theory predicts. For the Polity 
dependent variable, it is only signiﬁcant in the bivariate speciﬁcation. 
[Table 2 about here] 
The lack of signiﬁcance in the Polity regressions could arise because changes in Polity are capturing 
something other than real changes in the level of democracy (minor reforms, or measurement error by 
the coders), or because the Democracy results are spurious. To investigate further, these regressions 
were rerun twice, with alterations to the dependent variable: (1) only counting a change in the level 
of democracy if the Polity score moved by 3 or more points and (2) only counting a change if Polity 
moved by 3 or more points, and the head of state was removed by irregular means, according to the 
Archigos dataset of political leaders (Goemans, Gleditsch and Chiozza, 2009). Using only large changes 
does not affect the signiﬁcance of Nbr Openness.20 However, as Table 3 shows,when only large changes 
combined with irregular removal of the head of state are counted, the results change: the coefﬁcient on 
Nbr Openness becomes much larger, and is signiﬁcant in the ﬁxed effects speciﬁcation. This suggests 
that the weak results from thePolityregressions are due to consensual reforms that result in small changes 
to the Polity score, and/or to subjective coding decisions.

It is unlikely that changes to the level of democracy arise similarly in democracies and dictatorships, and it is clearly of interest whether asset mobility has the same effect in each case. To investigate this, I run a dynamic logit model, allowing the effects of the independent variables to vary depending on whether the country is a democracy. Thus, the estimations become:

Results are shown in Table 4.21 In each model, the ﬁrst column shows the effect of the independent 
variables on the odds of a dictatorship becoming a democracy, and the second column shows their effect 
on the odds of a democracy becoming a dictatorship. The table clariﬁes the effect of Nbr Openness. As 
the theory predicts, this is negative for both kinds of transitions. However, the coefﬁcient on dictatorships 
is much smaller in size, and becomes insigniﬁcant in the ﬁxed effects speciﬁcation. Thus, democracies 
appear to be stabilized by their neighbors’ ﬁnancial openness, while the evidence that the same holds 
true for dictatorships is weaker. 
To check the robustness of this result, I reran the dynamic logit including some further independent 
variables which are often supposed to affect the probability of transitions. Table 5 shows the results. 
Model 1 includes a variable for urbanization. Model 2 includes population and country size. The effects 
of Nbr Openness do not change signiﬁcantly in either model. In further robustness checks, I varied 
the sample, by including OECD countries and by excluding Soviet countries. Again, results are not 
substantively different.22 
21Dynamic ﬁxed effects logit models suffer from bias if the initial value of the dependent variable is correlated with the ﬁxed effects (this is the “initial conditions problem”). To avoid this, I also ran a random effects model controlling for per-country averages of the IVs, as in Wooldridge (2005). Results were substantively similar to the ﬁxed effects estimations. Also, the ﬁxed effects model is very similar to a model in which the dependent variable is the logged odds of country i being a democracy at time t, rather than the logged odds of a transition at time t. (The two models are not identical, since the country ﬁxed effects have different interpretations.) Again, running this model gives substantively the same results.

========19========

[Table 5 about here] 
Lastly, to show the substantive size of the results, Figure 3 plots the predicted probabilities of a transition 
for each of the sample countries in the year 2000, against their predicted probabilities if their value of 
Nbr Openness over the past 5 years had been one standard deviation higher.23 The lines show roughly the 
proportional change in probabilities: democracies would be about 1/3 as likely to experience a transition, 
and dictatorships would be about 3/4 as likely. 
[Figure 3 about here] 
4.3 Interpretation 
The cross-country evidence shows that countries were signiﬁcantly less likely to experience transitions 
to or from democracy when their neighbors had recently been ﬁnancially open. This effect is most clear 
for breakdowns in democracy. Coefﬁcients are smaller for democratic transitions, and fail to achieve 
signiﬁcance in the ﬁxed effects speciﬁcation. Thus, the evidence supports Hypothesis 1b, and offers 
weaker support for Hypothesis 1a. 
It is interesting to consider how alternative theories might explain the link between asset mobility and 
changes in democracy. One theory is that economic growth leads to transitions, and that neighboring 
countries’ openness to capital increases wealth in a way not captured by GDP. However, Table 4 shows 
that within a country, higher GDP is associated with greater democratic stability but not with transi- 
tions to democracy. The same holds for neighboring countries’ openness. Thus, a mechanism affecting 
democratic stability via increasing GDP cannot be ruled out, but theories in which wealth causes democ- 
ratizations are not supported. Another theory claims that ﬁnancial openness is associated with the spread 
of democratic ideas. The control on neighbors’ Polity scores is meant to capture this effect. Table 4 
shows that neighbors’ Polity scores are indeed associated with democratizations. However, there is no 
evidence that neighbors’ ﬁnancial openness causes democratizations: if anything, the reverse. Lastly, 
ﬁnancial openness might alter the industrial structure, increasing the power of the urban bourgeoisie. 
Controlling for urbanization (Model 1 in Table 5) does not change the effect of ﬁnancial openness, and 
23Since conditional logits cannot be interpreted in terms of unconditional probabilities, the estimation without ﬁxed effects was used, i.e. Model 2 in Table 4. 
19 

========20========

indeed urbanization appears to increase the likelihood of democratic breakdowns. Nevertheless, other 
unobserved changes in social structure cannot be ruled out. 
In short, while factor mobility’s effect on democracy is strongly supported in this data, it may work via 
a different mechanism from the one proposed here. However, most extant theories predict that global- 
ization should be positively associated with democratization as well as democratic stability, while the 
theory here predicts an association with stability of both democracies and dictatorships, and in this sense 
is closer to what the data shows. 
5 Conclusion 
In the political economy literature to date, globalization has been understood as a process which beneﬁts 
some groups in society and harms others, leading to class or factor coalitions which seek to extend or 
mitigate its effects, and encouraging democratization by protecting capital owners from redistributive 
taxation. This leaves out an important part of the story, which is that factor mobility forces states’ 
rulers to compete more in providing services to those under their rule. This paper examines the political 
implications, arguing that interstate competition substitutes for internal competition. When democracy 
has costs as well as beneﬁts – as may be the case in many developing countries (Bates, 2008) – increasing 
external competition will alter the tradeoffs for citizens, lowering their demand for democracy so that 
there is more political stability but also less democratization. When democracy has been established in 
a country, the same logic lowers rulers’ incentives to attempt antidemocratic coups, since their level of 
rents will be limited even in an autocracy by external competition. Overall, there is simply less to ﬁght 
over when factor mobility constrains the sovereign. The evidence shows that factor mobility is indeed 
associated with fewer breakdowns in democracy, and there is some evidence that it also causes fewer 
democratizations. 
For political scientists, the view of globalization as heightened competition between state apparatuses 
leads to further interesting research possibilities. In particular, future work could focus on integrating 
redistribution and agency concerns. How do elites weigh the risks of unconstrained dictatorship against 
those of taxation by the poor under democracy, and how does their exit option affect this trade-off? 
20 

========21========

Another development would be to analyse how and when rulers choose to increase the costs of exit, for 
instance by limiting visas, imposing capital controls or policing their borders. Lastly, there are cases 
where factor mobility seems linked to political pathologies. For instance, in Fiji, ethnic tensions may 
have been exacerbated by the ease of exit (if it is easy to leave, it may also be easy to force others out); 
while in Zimbabwe, as described in Section 3.6, the mass exodus of workers to South Africa may have 
pushed rulers towards a strategy of short-term plunder. Qualitative case studies would help develop our 
understanding of these more complex dynamics.

Appendix 1: Proofs 
I ﬁrst prove that the bad type ruler invests either Lˆ or 0. 
Proof. Lˆ is the interior maximizer of (1 
 d)(f(L) 
 u) 
 L. If L > 0 and f(L) 
 u  0 then the ruler 
receives 
 L utility and would prefer to set L = 0. Otherwise, if L > Lˆ, then by concavity of (2), the 
ruler could reduce L a little and increase his expected utility; if L < Lˆ, then by concavity, the ruler could 
increase L and increase his utility. 
Using this I prove Claim 1: 
Proof. From (2), investing Lˆ gives 
(1 
 d)(f(Lˆ) 
 u)+ 
 Lˆ 
while investing 0 gives 
(1 
 d)(  u)+: 
If u0 then these become (1 
 d)(1 
 u+ f(Lˆ)) 
 Lˆ and (1 
 d)(1 
 u) respectively. Since (1 
 d)f(Lˆ) 
 
Lˆ > 0 by the deﬁnition of Lˆ and by concavity of f, Lˆ gives more utility. 
If u> f(Lˆ) the two expressions become 
 Lˆ and 0 respectively; investing 0 is preferred since costly effort 
will not prevent migration. 
If 0 < u < f(Lˆ) then the expressions are (1 
 d)(f(Lˆ) 
 u) 
 Lˆ and 0. Rearranging gives the condition in 
the Claim. 
24 

========25========

Lastly I show that if (1 
 d)(f(Lˆ) 
 u) > Lˆ then u  f(Lˆ), and that if u  0 (and Lˆ > 0) then (1 
 
d)(f(Lˆ) 
 u) > Lˆ. Therefore, the condition in the Claim covers all three cases. 
If(1 
 d)(f(Lˆ) 
 u)>Lˆ thenu f(Lˆ), since otherwise(1 
 d)(f(Lˆ) 
 u)<0Lˆ. Ifu0 andLˆ >0 then 
(1 
 d)(f(Lˆ) 
 u)  (1 
 d)f(Lˆ) > Lˆ. The second inequality holds because Lˆ solves f0(Lˆ) = 1=(1 
 d) 
and f is strictly concave. 
I next show that LB(d;u) is decreasing in d and that there is a discontinuous jump downwards at the crossover point from investing Lˆ to investing 0. 
Proof. First remember that Lˆ is decreasing in d. Next, recall that zero investment occurs when Lˆ  
(1 
 d)[f(Lˆ) 
 u]. This is true when u is high enough; it is then no longer worthwhile for the ruler to 
invest. It is also true for high enough d. To see this, differentiate the LHS of (6) with respect to d to give 
u 
 f(Lˆ): 
(The effects of d on Lˆ cancel out since f0(Lˆ) =1=(1 
 d).) This expression increases in d. If u>0, when 
d is high enough it will be positive, so that an increase in d increases the LHS of (6); but if so (6) must 
hold in any case, since Lˆ  0  (1 
 d)[f(Lˆ) 
 u]. For lower values of d it becomes negative (since as 
d ! 0, Lˆ ! L, and f(L) > u), and if so a further decrease in d will increase the LHS of (6) and may 
make the inequality false. Also, at the crossover point, Lˆ > 0 unless d = 1, by deﬁnition of Lˆ. (Indeed, at 
d = 1 (6) always holds with equality.) But if there is another crossover point, it must have d < 1. Hence 
Lˆ > 0 at the crossover point. 
Thus, for given u, either LB(d;u) =0 always, or LB(d;u) starts at L, decreases until the inequality holds, at which point Lˆ is positive, and thereafter is constant at 0. 
Finally the Lemmas are proved. 
25 

========26========

Proof of Lemma 2 
Proof. When the bad ruler invests positively, LB = Lˆ > 0. From Claim 1 it can be seen that this holds for an open subset of the parameters u and d. So we can set LB = Lˆ on an open subset around any given d and u. Since u < f(Lˆ) = f(LB) by the conditions in Claim 1, citizen utility can be rewritten as 
g f(L) + (1 
 g)[dg f(LB(d;u)) + (1 
 dg)u] 
Differentiating this by d gives the expression in (5). Differentiating again by u gives 
¶2UCIT ¶d¶u 
= 
 (1 
 g)g < 0; 
since Lˆ is constant in u. The negative cross-partial sufﬁces to show decreasing differences. 
Proof of Lemma 3 
Proof. From (2), the ruler’s utility can be written UB = (1 
 d)(f(Lˆ) 
 u) 
 Lˆ, since f(Lˆ) 
 u by the 
conditions for positive investment in Claim 1. As before, this holds on an open interval around our pa- 
rameters. Differentiating this ﬁrst by u then by d gives 
¶2UB 
¶d¶u 
=1>0, which shows increasing differences. To show thatUB is decreasing in d, apply the Envelope Theorem: 
¶UB 
¶d 
=  (f(Lˆ)  u) < 0. 
Proof of Proposition 4 
Proof. The ruler decreases d (by the maximum amount D, since his utility is decreasing in d) if 
UB(d 
 D) 
 c UB(d); 
and this deﬁnes a cutpoint 
c¯ =UB(d 
 D) 
 UB(d) =

below which the ruler changes d. The condition in the Proposition, combined with the previous Lemmas, 
shows that 
¶2UB 
¶d¶u 
>0 for all d 2[d  D;d+D]. Therefore, an increase (decrease) in u decreases (increases) c¯. Since the distribution of costs has full support on R+, the probability that c  c¯ is strictly less (more) 
if u increases (decreases). 
The argument for the citizens is almost identical and is omitted.24 
24If citizens could choose to decrease
